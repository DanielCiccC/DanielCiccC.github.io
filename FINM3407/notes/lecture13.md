> - Different strains of overconfidence
>   - Miscalibrated - mean value and range tests
>     - Expected value you predict to have
>     - 95% confidence interval, giving a narrow range indicates you think your answer is correct
>
> Any questions asking about overconfidence
> - If the question is not specific about a strain - saying they are saying
>   - really specific strain - then be specific
> - EXAM TIP - asking for more general bias, in particular 'showing' illusion of control e.g.
>  - Don't give extra assumptions
>
> Impact on decision making
> - underdiversification - illusion of control - maybe a bit of miscalibration
>   - underestimation of the risk that they may encounter

Managerial Overconfidence
1. Overinvestment

Cashflows
3. More Active in M&A
4. Too Quick to Start New Businesses

> - institutional - more knowledgable
>   - Still exhibit overconfidence but for different reasons
> - Managers decision can be affected
>   - Capital budgeting
>   - Should act in the best interest of shareholders
> - Make decision based on the best approach - may choose the other because it is easier
> - Loss Aversion
>   - Start an investment, do not stop evaluation
>   - Should not continue, stop/terminate it but do not because of loss aversion
>   - Take into account sunk cost
>   - Treat it as the money that you pay
>
> Affects will influence decision making as well
> - may choose something suboptimal but may have a positive feeling
>
> Managerial overconfidence
> - Tend to overinvest
> - Higher sensitivity to cashflows
> - Not all overconfidence is bad

  - Overestimating Predictability

- Bias Related to Representativeness
  - Recency
  - Salience
  - Availability
- Anchoring
  - Seems contradicting with Representativeness
  - Coarsely Calibrated


> - perceptions will effect how we evaluate situations
>   - different heuristics
> - not always influenced by primacy or recency effects
>   - Time gap in between, more effect by the latency effect
>
> Heuristics
> - Mental shortcuts
> - not the same as mental biases
> - Type 2 heuristics can override type 2 decision
>
> Representativeness
> - Two most important is conjunction fallacy and base rate neglect
> - Conjunction
>   - thinking the joint has a higher probability that the base rate
> - Base rate neglect
>   - Conditional probability - forecasting rent e.g.
>   - Adding new information, influenced and miscalculate the base rate
>   - Difficult calculations from the course
>
> Hot hand phenomenon
> - Really good past performance, high chance they are going to perform good in future
>
> Gamblers fallacy
> - complete opposite
>
> Overestimating predictability
> - Overestimating the predictability of using one to predict the other
>
> Salience
> - What information are we using to represent something else
> - More dramatic, going to be in your memory more
>
> Availability
> - Easier to recall, effected by that more
>
> Anchoring
> - not adjusting
> - contradicting representativeness
>   - Which is more influence by later information 
> - More effected by new information
> - Can suddenly switch to representativeness

### Part Two
- Home Bias
  - Implied Under Diversificaiton
  - Language & Culture
  - Information Advantage
- Representativeness
  - Good Companies vs. Good Investments
- Anchoring
- Momentum-Chaser vs. Contrarian


> - tend to under-diversify our portfolio
>   - nationally - know language/culture, safer decision
>
> Representatives
> - Tend to think good companies are good investments
>   - Good management characteristics, making good products
>   - Should already be reflected in the price
>   - Good companies does not mean they are good investments
>
> Momentum anomalies
> - Look at momentum, 
> - see something increasing, believe it is going to decrease

>
> Pride and regret

>
> Disposition effect
> - Emotional side, because of pride and regret
> - tendency to sell winners early and hold onto losers
> - risking seeking and risk aversion aligning with prospect theory
>

>   - Not adjusting reference point quickly enough
>   - Reference point is not adjusting quick enough to fundamental value
>   - Underreaction, not to the fundamental because the reference point is not changing
>   - Do not worry about big equations, but understand how it works
>
> BSV
> - Overreaction and underreaction
> - Even though share price should be random walk, cannot predict future
> - Believe market is in regime 1 or 2, changing or persistent
> - belief effects reaction to past earning
> - In regime 1, underreact to past earning signals

>   - rotation, more aggressive, based on short term evaluation 
>
> Refine value investing
> - Simply using accounting data with F-score
>
> Momentum
> - Capture momentum cycle, capture the timing to enter/buy stock
> - Capture using volume
>
> Momentum and reversal
>
> Momentum and Value investing
> - Do not see these effects, capturing different things, small portfolio capturing both criteria
>
> Multivariate
> - look at all the factors
> - separate into five categories, found that we can outperform the market
> - momentum, value and volumes are the three values that are most inportant
>
> Does behavioural finance actually work?
> - not providing strong evidence suggesting


### Final Exam

- Reading: 10 minutes
- Duration: 120 minutes
- Format: Short answer, Short essay, Problem solving
- Task Description:
The final assessment will be based on all materials covered in the course (from Topics 1-10).
The exam includes short answers, short essays, and problem-solving questions. No MCQ

> - need to know how to apply that in a scenario

How to Prepare for the Exam
- Go through the slides in detail (including examples)
- Practice lecture examples, tutorial questions, & practice exam and try to get a deep understanding of the examples and questions.
- Read the reference chapters of the textbook and other references (for the relevant content)
- It is more important to understand the concepts and know how to apply them, rather than simply memorising the definitions (won’t give you full marks)
