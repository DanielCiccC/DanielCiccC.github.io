# Lecture 2 -  Prospect Theory, Framing and Mental Accounting

- Prospect theory was developed by two psychologists, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) based on observing actual behaviour (aka. Positive model).
- Experimental evidence suggests that individuals frequently deviate from the behavioural predictions of expected utility theory (Normative model).
- Prospect theory has a solid mathematical basis. 
- Unlike expected utility theory which concerns itself with how decisions under uncertainty should be made (a prescriptive approach), prospect theory concerns itself with how decisions are actually made (a descriptive approach)

> - Make decisions to maximise their expected utility
> - behave against expected utility theory
>   - not behaving the way we should, observing actual behaviour, can still quantify and model
>
> Still based on mathematical theory
> - expected utility is more a normative model

### Recap:

- Expected Utility can be defined as:

$$E(U) = \sum^{N}_{i=1}P_{i}U(w_{i})$$

Where:
- $P_{i}$ - probability of each outcome
- $U(w_{i})$ is the utility derived from each outcome ($w_{i}$ = wealth)

**Example:**
- If you face this gambling opportunity: 50% win $105, 50% lose $100. Take it?
- If you are an expected utility maximizer with wealth W, you should take the gamble if
current utility < expected utility
  - expected outcome - $2.5
- Von Neumann and Morgenstern 
  - if you follow certain axioms, you must maximize ‚Äúexpected utility.‚Äù


$$U(W) < 0.5 \times U(+\$105) + 0.5 \times U(-\$100)$$

### Loss Aversion vs. Risk Aversion

**Loss Aversion**
- Strong preference to avoid losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains.
- Feelings of loss are psychologically about twice as powerful as feelings of gain.
- May lead to taking bigger risks to avoid losses.

> Strong aversion to avoid losses
> - may make the same decision, but for a different reason

- Preference for lower levels of risk and uncertainty.
- Choice of guaranteed outcomes, even if less profitable.
- Drives decisions towards certainty over uncertainty.

> Based on the uncertainty you are facing
> - will sacrifice higher rewards for something more certain

### Development of prospect theory
- The prospect theory was proposed in 1979 to address certain empirical observations that Expected Utility Theory failed to explain.
  - Value vs. Utility & Difference in Wealth vs. Total Wealth 

Three Key characteristics of the value function include:
- Reference Dependence: Value perception is relative to a specific reference point, typically the status quo.
- Loss Aversion: Losses impact utility more than equivalent gains.
$$v(x) < -v(-x)$$
- Diminishing Sensitivity: Sensitivity to wealth changes decreases as the magnitude of gain or loss increases.

> - use value function, not utility
>   - look at the difference in wealth
> - losses, more risk seeking, gains, more risk averse

- These 3 aspects make Prospect Theory more fitting than Expected Utility Theory in high-risk and uncertain situations.

### Common value functional form of Prospect Theory

**Positive Domain**
$$v(z) = z \alpha  \; \text{for} \; z‚â•0, \; \; 0< \alpha <1  $$

- $z$ is change in wealth (horizontal line)
- Value function (not utility) so $v$ is used.

> Value functions
> - alpha, determines the curvature of your graph
> - smaller, the more curved it will be
> 

**Negative Domain**
$$  v(z) = -\lambda(-z)^{\beta} \; \text{for} \; z<0, \lambda >1, \;\; 0<\beta<1 $$

- The factor $\lambda$, which is greater than 1, introduces loss 
aversion 
- The parameter Œ≤ (0<Œ≤<1) controls the curvature of 
the function on the loss side, similar to Œ± on the gain 
side (see Appendix). 
- Kink at origin.

> Beta determines curvature of graph
> - lambda; people are loss averse

### Common ratio effect

Prospect pair 4 ‚Äì choose between:
- A: (.9, $2000) 
- B: (.45, $4000)
Most people opt for? - A

> - positive domain, tend to be more risk averse

Prospect pair 5 ‚Äì choose between:
- A: (.002, $2000) 
- B: (.001, $4000)
Most people opt for? - B

> risk-seeking attitude

**Invoke linear transformation rule:**

Prospect pair 4:
$$0.9u(2000) > 0.45u(4000)$$

$$2u(2000) > u(4000) 0.45$$

- This  reflects  the  fact  that  individuals  prioritize  the  high  probability  of 
winning a smaller amount ($2000) over the lower probability of winning a 
larger amount ($4000).

Prospect pair 5

$$0.001u(4000) > 0.002u(2000)$$
$$u(4000) > 2u(2000)$$

- This  shows  the  contradiction  where  people  are  choosing  a  smaller expected utility when it comes to small probabilities, opting for the chance to win a larger amount ($4000) despite the lower likelihood.

> more people chose spin the wheel
> - overall utility for A should be more than B


### Reconciliation Through Prospect Theory:
The answer lies in its **nonlinear weighting function**. In  Prospect  Theory,  probabilities  are  not  treated linearly. *Small probabilities* are **overweighted**,  which means they seem larger than they are, and *moderate to  high  probabilities*  are  **underweighted**,  appearing smaller than they are.

This  distortion  of  probabilities  can  make  option  B  in Prospect Pair 5 seem more attractive than it would be under  expected  utility  theory,  thus  reconciling  the 
apparent contradiction.

### Lottery effect

Prospect pair 6 -- choose between:
- A: (0.001, $5,000)
- B: ($5)

Most prefer A which is inconsistent with risk aversion.
- People  seem  to  overweight  low-probability events  (which  is  why  people  buy  lottery tickets)

### Insurance

Prospect pair 7 -- choose between:
- A: (0.001, -$5,000)
- B: (-$5)

Most prefer B which is inconsistent with risk seeking.
- Insurance need
- Once  again,  people  seem  to  overweight  low-probability  events  (which  is  why  people  buy insurance)

> Overweight low probability


### Certainty effect

Prospect pair 8 -- choose between:
- A: (0.2, $4000) ‚Üí E(w) = 800
- B: (0.25, $3000) ‚Üí  E(w) = 750

Prospect pair 9 ‚Äì choose between:
- A: (0.8, $4,000)  ‚Üí E(w) = 3200
- B: ($3000)  ‚Üí E(w) = 3000

Most choose 8A and 9B, but they shouldn‚Äôt.
- Certainty is accorded high weight relative to near-certainty

> prospect 9 - higher expected outcome
> - something with higher probability vs guaranteed for sure - we prefer certainty

### Prospect Theory: More than two outcomes

Prospect  theory  assumes  people  maximize  a  ‚Äúweighted  sum  of  utilities,‚Äù  although  the 
weights are not the same as the true probabilities, and the ‚Äúutilities‚Äù are determined by a 
value function rather than a utility function:

$$Max: E(v) =  œÉ ùùÖ(ùíëùíä) √ó (ùíôùíä ‚àí ùíì)$$

- Where  ùùÖ  is a non-linear weighting function,
- v( xi  - r) is the value function evaluated with respect to the reference point, r 
[Change in Wealth]

> - $r$ is your reference point

### Weighting function
- The decision weighting function is non-linear with the probability p. 
  - That is, decision weights are not probability.
  - They do not obey the probability axioms.
  - They should not be interpreted as measures of belief.
- Properties of the weighting function: 
  - ùùÖ‚Ä≤ ùê© > ùüé  is an increasing function of p - ùùÖ (0) = 0:  outcomes contingent on an impossible event are ignored - ùùÖ (1) = 1: scale is normalised so the certainty event has a œÄ value of 1. For small p,  ùùÖ (r*p) > r ùùÖ (p) where $0<r<1$:ùùÖ  is subadditive
  - Ex:  $ùùÖ (0.001)/ ùùÖ (0.002) > 1/2$
  - Meaning: when winning is possible but not probable (i.e., small p), most people choose the prospect that offers larger gain : V(6,000, 0.001) > V(3,000, 0.002)

> - weight is not probability
> - probability of a sample space is equal to 1
>   - not the case for weighting - objective feeling
>
> Increasing function
> - weighting function is monotonically increasing

### Weighting function notes
This (displayed) mathematical function is

$$\pi (pr) = pr^{\gamma}  / [pr^{\gamma}  + (1- pr)^{\gamma} ] (1/^{\gamma})  , \text{where} \;\; \gamma = .65$$

- Weighting function for losses can vary from weighting function for gains.
- Low probabilities are given relatively higher weights than more probable events.
- And certainty is weighted highly vs. near-certainty. 
- Using functions like this solves some earlier puzzles.

> - expected utility function is a special case where they treat prospect theory like expected utility function

### Valuing prospects under prospect theory

$$V(P) = \pi(pr_{A}) * v(z_{A}) + \pi(1 - pr_{A}) * v(z_{B})$$

Steps:
- Convert probabilities to decision weights
- Calculate values of wealth differences
- Use the above formula
