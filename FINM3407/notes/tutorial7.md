# Tutorial 7 - Topic 5 Application to Managerial Overconfidence 

## Part One: Application to Managerial Overconfidence 

### 1*. Differentiate the following terms/concepts: 
**a.  Payback and NPV:**

- Payback is how long it takes for an investment to return its outlay in cashflows without regard 
for time value.  
- NPV properly takes into account time value by discounting all positive and negative cash flows and summing them up.  A positive-NPV project, since it adds value, should be adopted.  


b.  Holding in-the-money options too long and engaging in frequent acquisitions: 
 
These are both proxies for managerial overconfidence. 

Overconfident managers, thinking that their firms will perform well in the future, are happy to expose themselves to own-firm-specific risk even when diversification gains are available. 

- CEOs often receive stock and option grants as compensation.  This is done so that shareholders’ and managers’ interests are aligned.  While there are limitations as to when options can be exercised, at some point managers do have the ability to exercise them.   
- One metric that can be used for overconfidence is the tendency to voluntarily hold a large number of in-the-money options (that optimally from the standpoint of diversification gains should be exercised but that are still being held).   
- A second metric that has been used for overconfidence in managers is engaging in frequent acquisitions. The argument is that only egregiously overconfident managers engage in a spate of deals within a short period of time.
