Questions to ask:

(Topic 5)
### By taking credit for successes but assigning blame for failures, Jordan is most likely demonstrating:  
A. loss-aversion bias.  
**B. self-attribution bias.**
C. illusion of knowledge bias.  

B is correct. Self-attribution is a bias in which people take credit for successes and assign 
responsibilities  for  failure.  Jordan  attributes  successful  decisions  to  herself  while  poor 
decisions are attributed to the team. Her self-esteem affects how she looks at success and failure. 
Self-attribution  and  illusion  of  knowledge  biases  contribute  to  overconfidence  bias,  which 
Jordan clearly demonstrates later when she tells the team that she knows what she is doing.
