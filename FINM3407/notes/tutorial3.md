- Efficient Market Hypothesis
> - Assume the market is efficient, 
>   - 3 forms, weak, semi-strong, strong form
- Challenges to market efficiency
> - Behaviour perspectives, some challenges to market efficiency

### 11.
Behaviour finance combines cognitive psychological theory with conventional economic and finance.

It challenges the traditional views on market efficiency by introducing concepts of cognitive biases that can lead to irrational finance decisions, thus market inefficiencies.
> Loss aversion - investors lose more than they gain
> - More types of behavioural finance and how it ties to EMH

### Q1

**Momentum and reversal**

- With momentum we observe positive correlation in returns, whereas with reversal we observe negative correlation in returns

--- ADD IMAGE FOR clarity
> Momentum is the observed tendency for rising asset prices or securities return to rise furtherm and falling prices to keep falling.
> - But an increase in price

**Value and growth stocks**
- Stock prices for value stocks are **low** relative to accounting measures such as earnings, cash flow, or book value, whereas stock prices for growth (or glamour) stocks are high relative to earnings, cash fow, and book value, at least in part because the market anticipated/predicts high future growth

**Fundamental risk and noise-trader risk**
- Fundamental risk arises because of the potential for *rational revaluation as new information arrives* and
- Noise-trader risk arises because mispricing can be *more severe in the short turn*. Some people may not be happy

> - Noise trader risk should be in the short term only.

**Carve-out and stub value**
- A carve-out is an offering of shares in a *subsidiary company*. When a company sell a minority interest of a subsidiary interest to outside investors
  - Allows a company to capitalise on a business segment that may not be part of core business

Stub value is the implied standalone value of the parent company without the subsidiary
- Stub is a security that is created as a result of a corporate restructuring such as a bankruptcy, or recapitalisation in which a portion of a company's equity is separated from the company's stock

### Q3 

- When you are managing your own money, you are subject to *fundamental risk* and *noise-trader risk*. Plus some arbitrageurs will normally have a limited pool of capital to use for arbitrage purposes.

If you are managing other people's money, you will often *have more capital* in your control. But you will be subject to *a different sort of wealth control*. Because they have the power to hire and fire, your horizon is of necessity short. In fact, many who are attempting to exploit arbitrage opportunities are subject to this reality. They are managing money for individuals (pooling their money through hedge funds).

### Q4 

It is always possible to detect correlations in data merely due to randomness
- Data snooping is the act of analyzing a dataset to 'death' so as to detect correlations, which are then termed anomalies
- Correlations should exhibit some *consistency*

> - Same data will increase the likelihood of overfitting
> - Multiple testing
> - Selection bias (people you select will be more significant in some hypothesis)

### Q5

The three supports are (1) investor rationality, (2) uncorrelated errors and (3) unlimited arbitrage. 
- If the first holds, prices will be on average right and markets will be efficient. 
- If the first does not hold, but the second does hold, while errors will be made, once again on average prices will be right. 
- If the first two do not hold, but the third does hold, while prices have the potential to diverge from value because errors are often one-sided, arbitrageurs will notice such opportunities and swiftly take action so as to eliminate mispricing.

> - unlimited value of arbitrage (3)
> - If one of the three conditions hold, the 'average price' would be right

### Q6
Market efficiency is a situation where the prices of securities reflect all available information at any given time. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) assumes that all investors have costless access to currently available information about the future, they are rational, and they adjust their expectations instantly to reflect new information.

Prices will react instantaneously and without bias to the release of information in such a way that abnormal returns cannot consistently be made. 

> - All information reflected in the current price
> - cannot create arbitrage - there is no way to 'beat' the market

EMH assumes that all investors:
1) have costless access to currently available information about the future
2) They are rational, and
3) They adjust their expectations instantly to reflect new information

### Q8.

1. Information asymmetry, where one party has more or better information than the other, creating an imbalance in the transaction. For example, a seller might know about an issue with a product that the buyer doesn't.
2. **Behavioral biases** like overconfidence or herd behavior can lead to irrational decisions, causing price distortions. For example, during the dotcom bubble, investors kept buying overpriced tech stocks, leading to a market crash.
2. **Market manipulation**, such as insider trading or price rigging, also pose challenges. The
case of Enron is a notable example of market manipulation. 
> Purchase a large amount of one stock, change the demand and supply of the stock and manipulate the market

### Q9. Discuss the concept of information asymmetry

Information asymmetry occurs when one party has more or better information than the other.
This can lead to market inefficiencies as the party with more information can exploit their
knowledge to gain an unfair advantage. For example, insider trading, where trades are made
based on non-public material information, directly challenges market efficiency.

> - trade on information before it is available to the public

### Q10

Irrational behavior, as explained by behavioral finance, suggests that investors often behave
irrationally, driven by cognitive biases rather than by objective information. This challenges
the EMH as it contradicts the assumption of *investor rationality*. Examples of irrational
behavior include overconfidence, anchoring, and herd behavior

### Q12
Market manipulation distorts prices and creates false trading volumes, undermining the
integrity of financial markets. For instance, the 2010 “Flash Crash” in the United States was
an example where high-frequency trading algorithms were blamed for causing a brief massive
drop in the stock market.

> - Flash crash in the United States was an example where high frequency trader algorithms were blamed for causing a brief massive drop in the stock market
> - Large sell order

### Q13 

High-frequency trading (HFT) uses complex algorithms to transact a large number of orders
at very fast speeds. While some argue that HFT provides liquidity, others contend that it can
cause market disruptions and create an uneven playing field, thus challenging market
efficiency

> - creates market manipulations and market disruptions

### Q15 

Regulation helps to maintain market efficiency by ensuring fair trade, preventing
market manipulation, and reducing information asymmetry. However, over-regulation can pose a challenge to market efficiency as it might stifle innovation and create barriers to entry, which may limit competition and create market distortions.

### Q17 
- on iPad

- Conservatism, people are slow to update their beliefs and underreact
- Regret avoidance, want to decrease their potential losses in the future. Reluctant to bear loss
- Mental accounting - people will value their money for different aims, differently
- Disposition effect - do not want to realise their losses.
