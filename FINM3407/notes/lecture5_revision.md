### Part One
- Neocalssical economics (normative theory)
1. Rational preferences
  - Completeness
  - Trainstivity
2. Maximise utility
  - The Expected Utility Theory of Prospect
  - Properties of Utility Functions
  - Certainty Equivalents
3. Independent decisions based on all “relevant” information

  - Loss Aversion
  - Representative
  - Mental Accounting
  - Fear of Regret

> Three assumptions
> - Should be rational 
>   - 'In a perfect world' we say so that we can make predictions about the future
>
> We should make decisions that maximise utility
> - It should be an always upper sloping curve
> - shape of utility will depend on preference
>   - Calculate expected utility
> - Certainty equivalent, what prospects will give the same utility
> - Risk averse, what should be the amount you are happy to get
>
> Four common types of biases
> - Mental accounting related to efficient market hypothesis

### Part two
- Foundations of Finance
1. Portfolio Risk & Return
- Portfolio Expected Return & Standard Deviations
- Efficient Frontier & CML
2. CAPM Model
3. Market Efficiency (more discussed in Lecture 3)
4. Agency Relationships & Corporate Governance
- Agency Costs (Direct vs Indirect)

> - traditional finance concepts
> - Market efficiency
> - Agency - direct and indirect costs
>
> Everything related to traditional finance is in appendix
> - go through appendix

## Lecture 2

[Part One – Prospect Theory]

- Overview about Prospect Theory
  - (1) Risk Aversion vs. Risk Seeking
  - (2) Development of Prospect Theory
- Prospect Theory Value Function
- The Weighting Function

[Part Two – Mental Accounting]
- Mental Accounting
  - (1) Integration vs. Segregation
  - (2) Theater Ticker Problems
  - (3) Opening and Closing Accounts

> - Value function, how we deal with probability
> - Mental accounting, how it affects how we make decisions

1. Risk aversion vs Risk seeking vs Loss aversion
2. Value Function
- Reference dependent
- Risk averse in positive domain
- Risk seeking in negative domain
  - Loss aversion
3. Weighting Function
- Overweighting low probabilities
- Underweighting medium-high probabilities
- Certainty effect
4. Framing & Mental Accounting Effect
- Segregation vs Integration (reference point)
- Silver lining effect & House money effect

> - With prospect theory, they are reference dependent
> - reference point, status quo
> - gaining or losing money will change how you deal with it
>   - **Identify risk aversion versus loss aversion**
> - The reason why we make decisions are based on different reasons
>   - Risk aversion - minimise uncertainty
>   - Loss aversion - don't like the loss, avoid the potential of losing in the future
>      - may increase your risk taking
> 
> Value function
>  - which one is adding to loss aversion
>
> Weighting function
> - don't look at probabilities rationally
> - psychological bias
>   - tend to overweight low probabilities
>   - medium to high probabilities, overweight it
> - When something is certain, the weighting function is not biased - will always be one (and zero is zero)
>   
> Framing
> - other biases affect 
> - Mental accounting with prospect theory - segregation vs integration
>   - People tend to integrate when you are winning money
>   - losing money, tend to segregate
> - silver lining
>   - tend to segregate losses
>   - firms do that as well (taking the bath)
>   - do not tend to have lots of small losses - push to small positive earnings
>     - have a major losses announcement - higher chances of positive increase in next financial period
>
> WILL NOT ASK HOW THE EQUATIONS ARE FORMED
> - need to know how to calculate it
> - prospect versus utility

## Topic 3: Challenges to Market Efficiency
[Part One – Efficient Market Hypothesis]
- Overview of Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Theoretical foundations and assumptions

[Part Two – Challenges to Market Efficiency]
- Rationales supporting the Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Theoretical Challenges and Empirical challenges


### Market Efficiency

1. 3 levels of efficiency
2. Implications: Better off do passive investing
3. Random Walk vs. EMH
  - “Prices are right” vs “No free lunch”
4. Theoretical Foundations
  - Universal Rationality
  - Uncorrelated Errors
  - Unlimited Arbitrage
5. Rationales Supporting Efficiency vs Effective Trading Rules (Anomalies?)

> EMH
> - Only new information will affect the market
> - People who are supporting market efficiency should only participate in pasive investing
>   - cannot beat the market, cannot do active investment
>
> Random walk vs EMH
> - Two scholars 
>   - Random walk - no one can beat the market, then the price should be efficient
>   - Can't make the link - doesn't necessarily mean the price is correct
>
> If was have a bunch of noise traders
> - if they are correlated and forms a sentiment, can move the market
>   - not based on information (needs to add value) tradings on errors
>   - pushing the price away from the fundamental (cannot predict it)
> - Cannot reject or support EMH
>
> Theoretical foundations
> - don't need all three
>   - universal rationality, can achieve EMH
>      - based on all relevant information
>   - If irrational investors decisions are uncorrelated, they will cancel out each other
>     - price moved by rational investors
>   - If we have unlimited arbitrage, opportunities to have risk free profit
>
> Rationals supporting efficiencies
>  - all the anomalies, momentums, 
>   - Should be at least semi-strong, should not be able to use past information
>   - Equal likely chance of spotting under/overreactions
>   - all the anomalies found could be due to methodologies
>     - Have to rely on asset pricing - man made models
>     - many adjustments, what is a universally affected method?

### Arbitrage
1. Triangular Arbitrage
2. Limits to Arbitrage
- Fundamental Risk
- Noise-trader Risk
- Implementation Costs

> - not unlimited
> - triangular arbitrage (three trades)
>
> Fundamental risk
> - idiosyncratic risk
> - capture fundamental risk
>
> Noise trader risk
> - systematic risk, before it gets better it can get worse
> - try to push the price back, noise traders may form a sentiment
> - cannot be eliminated or controlled
>   
>
> Implementation Costs
> - costs, fees, spread, risk
> - can be controlled but not eliminated
> - even if you can get it, after the cost
