# Tutorial 9 - Topic 8 Behavioural Explanations for Anomalies 

### 1*. Differentiate the following terms/concepts:
**a. Momentum and reversal**

- Momentum is positive correlation in returns, exist empirically over the medium term
- Reversal is a negative correlation in returns, the latter over the long term

> - Should be no overvalued or undervalued stocks

**b. Mean-reversion and continuation scenarios in the Barberis-Shleifer-Vishny (BSV) model**

- Investors expect positive/negative surprised to be followed by negative/positive surprises
- Under continuation, investors expect a positive/negative surprises to be followed by positive/negative surprises

**c. Size factor and book-to-market factor**

- In Fama french thee factor model, size and book-to-market are risk factors

> - Two risk factors still being incorporated into the model
> - Come up with more factors that could influence stock returns
> 

**d. Risk-based and behavioural explanations (for anomalies)**

- A risk-based (rational) explanation would argue that value stocks do better on average because they are riskier, as in the Fama-French model. 
- On the other hand, a behavioural model would say that anomalies exist because of investor error and limits to arbitrage.  The models in the chapter amount to behavioural explanations of anomalies. 

> - Arbitrage exists because of the limits to arbitrage


### 2*. In the context of the BSV model, explain intuitively (nontechnically) why two consecutive earnings changes in the same direction make investors less likely to think that they are in regime 1 (mean-reversion) vs. the case of two earnings changes in alternate directions

Investors, however, being coarsely calibrated, believe that stocks switch between two regimes.  

- Under regime 1, it is believed that earnings mean-revert. This means that a positive/negative 
earnings change is likely to be followed by a negative/positive earnings change in the next 
period. More formally, given a positive/negative earnings change, there is a low probability (pr 
L ) of another positive/negative earnings change in the next period. 
- Under regime 2, given a positive/negative earnings change, there is a high probability (pr  H ) of another positive/negative earnings change in the next period. In other words, it is believed that there is a continuation in earnings.  Note that pr  H  > pr  L . 

Two consecutive earnings changes in the same direction make it appear that Regime 2 is in effect (and Regime 1 is not in effect) since this is what we would expect in Regime 2. 


### 5*. Momentum is the anomaly that gives those subscribing to efficient markets the most trouble. Explain.

- Fama French three-factor model has a role for size and value but not momentum
- Some research related momentum to business cycle and the state of the market
  - non-diversifiable macroeconomic instruments account for a large portion of momentum profits
- time-varying CAPM with beta uncertainty can contribute to an explanation of momentum

### 6*. A series of Questions related to Factor Zoos:

**(a) What is Factor Zoo?**

- The “Factor Zoo” is a term used in the context of asset pricing to describe the proliferation of factors that have been identified as potentially explaining asset returns. 
- As research in this field has evolved, numerous factors have been proposed, tested, and debated, leading to a veritable “zoo” of factors. 

**(b) What is the development of academic research related to the “Factor Zoo”?**

- landscape of asset pricing factors is complex, hundred of proposed factors
- leading researching have raised concerns  about legitimacy
  - Use data minings and find and explain anomalies


### CFA question

- home bias may influence investor behaviour
- 
- Rather than doing thorough analysis, they might anchor to other analysis

- Moderately risk averse, risk averse bias
- Use the tax return to do travel, etc.
- Bad situations, mental accounting bias
- For the investor, mental accounting bias

Portfolio 2 has the same returns and sharpe ratios 

Mental account bias
- most likely select portfolio 2
- Suggests that he wants to compartmentalize his portfolio into discrete layers of low-risk assets verses risky assets without regards to the correlations among the assets

- some clients will view allocation 1 as the more profitable 1
- Prefer allocation 1, anything happens to 
- Result of framing bias, likely to choose an allocation based on a 1/n naive diversification strategy
- As a result of regret bias, likely to coose a conditional 1/n strategy to minimise any potential future regret from one of her funds outperforming another
- Would most likely select AllocationA
  - Ly believe that Calderon exhibits framing and regret biases
