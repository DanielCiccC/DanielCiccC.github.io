# Tutorial 11

### Part One: Behavioural Investing
1. Differentiate the following terms/concepts:
a. Style peer groups and style investing

- Consideration of style in portfolio formation
- Styles, growth, value mometum, dividend, others
- Each style has distinct characteristics and targets different types of stocks or assets based on set criteria that align with investor's goals and balances

b. Style tilting and style rotation
- tilts towards small-cap value because historically small-cap value has outperformed, practicing style-tilting
- Moving from style-to-style in an attempt to time aggregate style preference shifts

c. Financial soundness and financial statements
- Financial statements provides a sense of the firm's financial state, assets, liabilities, net worth along with income and cashflows

d. Univariate and multivariate approaches
- Univariate approach ti behavioural investing conditions on a single variable (e.g. past returns)
- One with higher past returns are going to have higher future returns
> - One of the risk factors could lead to higher or lower return

### 2. Describe how momentum can be refined by conditioning on the entire term structure of interest rates in the manner of the Grinblatt and Moskowitz regression model.

- Model is used to predict future returns based on past return
  - Higher past return means higher future return - momentum
  - Often ignores economic factors, need to focus on past price movement and situations
  - Longer maturity have higher interest rate, e.g.
  - Yield curve relative to interest rate could be downwards sloping

Model
- propose coniditioning the entire term structure of interest rates rather than looking at a single rate
- Incorporating multiple points on the yield curve (short, medium and long maturities)
- Grinblatt and Moskowitz found that my 

> - Profitability of long term strategies can be linked to shift in interest rates


### 3. Describe how value investing can be refined by paying close attention to a companyâ€™s financial statements.

- F-score attempts to separate stocks concentrating on those with financial soundness i.e. strength of financial position
- Proposed that we should concentrate with those with strong financial position
  - Going to increase a lot, 


### 4. What does the early evidence on the ability of behavioral investing to enhance performance tell us?

- 16 funds based on investment behaviour
  - Leveraging psychological insights/behavioural bias

Researchers tried to improve predictability of fama-franch
- key outcomes did not excessive returns that what could be predicted by fama-franch model plus the momentum factor
  - Just well-known risk factors
  - Fama french three-factor models - everything is consistent

5. What is an example of an anomaly that once reported in research studies has attenuated?
Is this positive or negative from the standpoint of market efficiency?

- research existence of anomaly - and when it will happen again
  - Avoid negative impact of anomaly

- Small-firm effect is an example. Small firm stocks historically outperform large-cap stocks over the long term
  - Actually negative from the standpoint of an effiicent view of the world since the Fama French three-factor model argues that firm size is a risk factor
  - Attenuation of the small-firm effect is a testament to the market's capacity for self-correction
