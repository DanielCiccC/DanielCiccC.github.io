# Tutorial 6: Overconfidence and investors

### 1. Terms/concepts

**a.  Miscalibration and excessive optimism**
- A person who overestimates the precision of his knowledge
  - May overestimate decisions of his/her knowledge
- excessive optimisms, thinks good things (succeeding in business venture, higher return, job offer)

**b.  Better-than-average effect and illusion of control**
- tendency for a person to rate.fell himself as above average (e.g. smarter)
- illusion of control, have more control over events than can objectively be true (control the outcome of wealth)

**c.  Self-attribution bias and confirmation bias**
- Self-attribution bias; the tendency to attribute successes to one's own abilities, while blaming failures on circumstances beyond one's control (forget our defeats)
- confirmation biases, tendency to search out evidence consistent with prior beliefs and ignore conflicting data
- Hindsight bias say we knew what was going to happen when we really didn't (e.g. 'I knew this would happen')

**d.  Pros and cons of overconfidence**

predictions are more optimistic when
- the event forecasted is in the more distant future
- when a person has committed to a course of action (e.g. practise a lot)

When these conditions are met, excessive optimism may be useful in enhancing performance

**2*.  Is miscalibration greater for easy questions or hard questions?  Is it greater when we look at 50% confidence ranges or 98% confidence ranges?**
- miscalibration tends to be greater for hard questions
- underconfident in the case of easy questions
- hard-easy effect

**4*.  Overconfidence does not quickly dissipate via learning because of the existence of contributing biases.  Explain.**
- Existence of overconfidence
- Self-attribution bias, the tendency for people to attribute successes or good outcomes to their own abilities, while blaiming failures to circumstances beyond their control
  - retards the learning process
- hindsight bias, which pushes people into thinking that 'they knew it all along' Going hand-in-hand with hindsight bias is confirmation bias, the tendency to search out evidence consistent with one's prior beliefs
  - Confirmation bias may contribute too

### 5*.  In 2007 the New England Patriots (an American football team) had a banner year winning all 16 regular season games.  

In these 16 games their points were: 38, 38, 38, 34, 34, 48, 49, 52, 24, 56, 31, 27, 34, 20, 28, and 38.  Despite this obvious success, their fans were still a bit overconfident going into the playoffs.  The consensus among fans was that they would average 50 points per game in the playoffs.  Plus their fans were 95% sure that they would be within five points of this number (45 to 55).  Illustrate the dimensions of  their  overconfidence.    (For  the  purpose  of  this  question,  assume  the  Patriots participated in four playoff games.)
