2. They are rational
3. They adjust their expectations instantly to reflect new information

> - Believe the stock will always trade at the fairest value
> - Investor rational, trading activities is always rational
> - Error is uncorrelated

- unlimited arbitrage - prices have the potential to diverge from value because errors are often one sided, arbitrageurs will notice such opportunities and swiftly trade for profit in the market
