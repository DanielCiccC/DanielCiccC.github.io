### Efficient Market Hypothesis - Overview

Only new information will move stock prices and this information is equally likely to be good news or bad news

The competition for information makes the capital market informationally efﬁcient.
- The market processes information quickly and efﬁciently
  -  Prices reﬂect the information in the market.
- Market efﬁciency can be categorised:
  - The weak form asserts that all information to be derived from past stock prices and trading volume is 
already reflected in stock prices.
  - The semi strong form claims that all publicly available information is already reflected.
  - The strong form, which generally is acknowledged to be extreme, asserts that all information, including 
insider information, is reflected in prices.

> - market will react immediately and stock prices will reflect it
> - Weak form - only past information
> - semi-strong - past and public information
> - Strong - all information will be reflected
>
> No answer of what form we are at
> 
> ![alt text](assets\IMG16.PNG)
>
> - market should incorporate all information already
> - negative earning announcement
>   - relatively stable


- But investors underreact to news, e.g., post earnings announcement drift (PEAD).
- The evidence is against semi-strong form efﬁciency
- i.e., Prices do not incorporate all public information quickly enough


> days from when earnings are announced
> - top group, market did react
> - effects continue 90 days after announcement
> - according to semi-strong form, should immediately reflect
>   - investors underreacting to the news
>   - didn't react quick enough - post-earnings announcement drift
>
> When the announcement is out (group 1, terrible earnings)
> - short position, that price will continue to drop
> - this is against the semi-string form
> - if it is, it should directly drop 
>

### Strong-form tests
- Do stock prices fully reﬂect all information including information known only to insiders (directors, 
management)?
- If insiders can freely trade on their inside information then we might expect their trading to move 
price to where it reﬂects that information 

Some studies have found insiders time their purchases and sales very proﬁtably on average.

> - even insider information should be reflected


### Efﬁcient Market Hypothesis - Implications
- Technical analysis: focuses on stock price patterns and on proxies for buy or sell pressure in the market.
- Fundamental analysis: focuses on the determinants of the underlying value of the firm, such as current 
profitability and growth prospects. 
- Because both types of analysis are based on public information, neither should generate excess profits if 
markets are operating efficiently. That is, either technical analysis or fundamental analysis is not useful in 
predicting security price movements.
Proponents of the efficient market hypothesis often advocate passive as opposed to active investment strategies. 
- The policy of **passive** investors is to buy and hold a broad-based market index. 
They expend resources neither on market research nor on frequent purchase and sale of stocks. 
That is, investors would be better off buying and holding an index fund or exchange traded funds (ETFs) than 
attempting to buy and sell individual securities or actively managed mutual funds. Examples: Track fund (2800) and H-share fund (2828)


> - we know it shouldn't use past information to capture profit
> - DDM-DCF - value true price of the firm through past financials
> - neither of these methods according to EMH should help you
>
> Might as well just do passive investment

### Random Walk vs Efficient Market Hypothesis

- Burton Malkiel: Yes, Random walk ➔ Efficient market hypothesis 
- Richard Thaler says: No, Random walk > Efficient market hypothesis
  - (1) Prices generated by noise traders could be random but could be deviated from the 
fundamental value.
  - (2) A drunk person walks on the street ➔ random walk, but not efficient. 
- Alternative interpretation (Richard Thaler) 
  - (1) Prices are right (EMH) ➔ No free lunch (no arbitrage opportunity)
  - (2) No free lunch > Prices are right (EMH)

> Nothing can be predicted - supporting EMH
> - active management will not
> - Even professional fund managers cannot beat the market
>   - Should be more informed than average investor
>
> Richard Thaler
> - noise traders - trading based on noise
> - large enough of a group and move in the same direction - form a consensus
>   - powerful enough to influence the market. Could be trading on misinformation. Not efficient - price is not always correct
>   - According to EMH, no arbitrage opportunities (no free lunch)
>     - Because the market has no free lunch, the market is efficient

### “Prices are right” vs. “No free lunch”
Ross  (2001)  and  Rubinstein  (2001)  point  to  the  inability  of  professional  money managers to beat the market as strong evidence of market efficiency. (Do you agree?)

- Barberis and Thaler (2003) argue that this statement is equivalent to the assumption that “no free lunch” ***implies*** “prices are right.”
- However, the performance of fund managers tells little about whether prices reflect fundamental value 

> - EMH, we can't beat the market
> - Just because we have random walk, means EMH cannot be true

### Efficient Market Hypothesis: Theoretical Foundations 
**Three arguments**
1. Investors are rational and they value securities rationally. (=> rational trades)
-  Rationality implies efficient market hypothesis.
1. However, EMH does not absolutely require rationality.
- Although some investors are irrational, if their trades are random, their irrational 
trades cancel out each other without affecting prices. (=> irrational random trades)
1. EMH does not even require noise traders’ uncorrelated actions. EMH depends on arbitrage (Fama, 
1965 and Friedman, 1953).
- Even if there are investors with systematic irrationality, rational arbitrageurs can correct the errors of 
noise traders. This is by far the most important. (=> no risk for arbitrage) 
- The simultaneous buy and sale of the same or essentially similar security in two different markets to 
take the advantage of different prices. 

> - We know all investors are not rational
> - As long as actions of noise traders are random, they should cancel each other out
>   - market still effected by rational only
>   - know not true - gamestop
>     - short position on gamestop, 
>
> As long as we have rational arbitrageurs
> - jump in to control the price
> - Spot the mismatch in price to spot the arbitrage profit

### Efficient Market Hypothesis: Assumptions
- The argument underlying the EMH is that investors are smart: 
  - They buy any security that is a “good deal”
  - They sell any security that is “overpriced” 
- Competition between investors ensures securities are properly priced. 

- Key assumptions: 
  -  Investors can access to and have the ability to process information
  -  Investors are rational (rational expectations and expected utility maximization)
  - There is no limit of arbitrage

> - Know something is a good deal, we want to buy it
> - follow the arbitrageurs
> - Constant buying and selling, competition ensures price will always move back to the fundamental price
> - Information acquisition cost should be free
>
> Given key assumptions EMH to work, no limit or cost, unlimited opportunities

### Rationales Supporting Efficiency
Fama (1998): Two reasons 
1. Anomalies are chance results 
- Apparent overreaction to information is about as common as underreaction. 
- Post-event continuation of pre-event abnormal returns is about as frequent as post-event reversal. 
2. Apparent anomalies can be due to methodology (more serious) 
- A joint test: Fama (1970) emphasizes that market efficiency must be tested jointly with a model for expected (normal) 
returns. (we covered in Lecture One).
- Bad-model problems 
  - Any asset pricing model is just a model and so does not describe expected returns (wrong model) 
  - Even if there were a true model, any sample period can produce systematic deviations from model’s predictions. (I.e., there are chances for 
sample-specific patterns). Example: CAPM does not seem to describe expected returns on small stocks (sample specific) 
  - To limit bad-model problems, one can use the market model or the comparison model approach (how to remedy)
  - The bad-model problem is less serious in event studies on short return windows. Bad-model errors in expected returns grow faster with the 
return horizon than the volatility of returns (short term: less a problem)

> Earnings announcement to capture strong EMH?
> - not something that can be easily captured
>
> Fama
> - Anomalies could be due to chance results
>   - overreaction to announcements
>   - Samples/period, random
>   - may not necessarily be true
>
> Apparent anomalies could be due to methodlogy
> - How do we test for abnormal returns
> - To test it, rely on some other asset pricing models
> - Calculate with CAPM, etc. To test market efficiency, must model it on something else as a proxy which may not be a good model
> - sample period can produce deviations
>
> Fame does not agree the market is efficent
> - cannot rule out that it is inefficient - not that simple


2. Apparent anomalies can be due to methodology (more serious) – continued…
- The return metric issues
  - Theoretical issue: Average “monthly” abnormal returns (AARs or CARs) vs. buy-and-hold 
abnormal returns
  - Statistical issues: each method has its own drawback 
  - Equal-weight returns vs. value-weight returns
  - Adjusted vs. unadjusted cross-sectional correlation
  - Most long-term anomalies tend to disappear with reasonable changes in technique

> - different methods have their own statistical issues
> - How can you say one is better than the other'
> - Too many variables in the test
> - In long time horizons, anomalies tend to disappear


**Other reasons:**
• Behavioral models are specific: Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyan (1997), and 
Hong and Stein (1998): 
- Work well on the anomalies they are designed to explain (short-term underreaction and long-term overreaction)
- Other anomalies are embarrassing. 
• Data mining (Lo and MacKinlay (1990)) 
- If a sufficient number of variables are correlated, some correlations will be statistically significantly different from zero. I.e., if 
we search enough, we can always find some anomaly in historical data. 
- Repeated visits to the same data set
- Long term data are not more persuasive
• Misinterpretation of size effect (Berk (1995)) 
- Operational size (such as total assets or sales) is unrelated to expected returns, but size is related to average return 
- Size is likely to proxy for omitted or misestimated risk 
• Econometric estimation limitations
- Sensitive to index inefficiency 
- Anomalies depend on econometric power 
• Attribute sorting problem (Ferson, 1996, 1998) - May create the illusion of false risk factors

> Cannot generalise it, 
> - a lot of reasons we cannot claim it is inefficient

### Key trading rules that have shown to be effective
Small cap portfolios vs. large cap portfolios?
- Small cap wins out!
Portfolios formed based on P/Es:
- Low P/Es do better!
Earnings announcements momentum:
- Reaction to extreme announcements is slow!

> - Book value (P/E ratios)
>   - High P/E ratio a gross firm

###  Key trading rules that have shown to be effective
Value vs. growth portfolios (usually value firm has a high book/market and a growth firm here is one with an absence of value):
- Go for value!
Predictable serial correlation:
- Medium-term momentum!
Long-term winners vs. losers:
- Reversals: losers become winners!


![alt text](assets\IMG20.PNG)

- In  Table  4.3,  the  returns  from  various  value  investing  (value  stocks  vs.  glamour/growth  stock) 
approaches (that is, using different price ratios as screens) are shown for the United States, Japan, the 
United Kingdom, France, and Germany during 1975–1995.1
- We  see  that  in  all  15  cases  value  stocks  outperformed  glamour  stocks,  where  value/glamour 
portfolios  were  formed  within  each  country  by  forming  portfolios  from  the  top/bottom  30%  of 
stocks for each year on the basis of beginning-of-year B/P, E/P, and CF/P.

> - Value stocks outperform glamour stocks


### Reversal evidence

Figure 4.2, based on five-year formation periods and future returns being tracked five years out, indicates that there are substantial differences.
The difference between winners and losers is stark, with  past  losers  substantially outperforming past winners. 

*Also salient from the figure are two other points:*
1. much of the difference is generated by the strong performance  of  losers  rather  than  the  weak performance of winners;
2. much of the return boost/drop occurs in the month of January


![alt text](assets\IMG21.PNG)

> More of the loser stock
> - decreasing of the winner stock
> - Always an increase/jump, sell loser stocks and buy them back again
> - Can't simply look at past and say market is efficient

### Momentum evidence

Several  years  later,  intermediate-term  (3–12  month) momentum was documented by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and 
Sheridan  Titman.  Their  approach  was  similar  to  that  of  De Bondt  and  Thaler  except  that  their  return  intervals  were shorter.  Table  4.4  reproduces  some  key  results  from  their paper. 

They  found,  for  example,  that  a long-short  zero-cost portfolio  formed  on  the  basis  of  returns  over  the  previous six  months  earned  an  average  excess  return  of  0.95%  per month over the next six months.

Also,  there  is  a relationship between post-earnings announcement drift and momentum—though whether momentum disappears  after  accounting  for  post-earnings announcement drift is a point of debate.

> Look at the past 6 months performance, and future 6 months performance


### Market efficiency requires that only one of the following three conditions need hold:
1. Universal rationality
2. Uncorrelated errors
3. Unlimited arbitrage

> - If we can achieve any one of these three, then the market is efficient
> - Investors are smart, react to mispricing, and ignoring noisy investor behaviour
> 
> ![alt text](assets\IMG23.PNG)

- One of main foundations of EMH is no-arbitrage condition.
- If there are pricing errors (e.g., caused by irrational investors) smart-money traders arbitrage them away.
- No free lunches are left on the table!

> - No limits to arbitrage - back to fundamental
>   - No free lunch setting

> How to arbitrageurs capture the profit?

### Triangular Arbitrage

Cross rates can be used to check on opportunities for intermarket arbitrage.  
Suppose the following exchange rates are available: 

- Barclays Bank: Australian dollars per pound sterling:   $A\$1.8410/£$
- Westpac Bank: Australian dollars per Euro:    $A\$1.2223/€$ 
- Deutsche Bank: Euro per pound sterling:       $€1.5100/£$ (market)

> - british pound is overvalued
>   - overvalued - sell it
