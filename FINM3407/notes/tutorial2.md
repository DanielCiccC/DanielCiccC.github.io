### 1.1 Lottery and Insurance
A lottery risk seeking prospect is a prospect with e *low probability* of a *high payoff* 
Many people buy lottery tickets, even with negative values. These same people buy insurance to proect themselves from risk
Normally, *insurance* is a hedge against a *low-probability large loss*

- Under prospects theory, people sometimes exhibit risk aversion and something exhibit risk seeking depending on the type of the prospect

### 1.b Segregation and integration
- Integration occurs when position are *lumped together*
- while segregation occurs when situations are *viewed one at a time*

> - reference point is the starting point from which people make decisions about gains and losses.
> - The value of an object is determined by the change in value between an object under consideration and that reference point
> - valuations of prospects depends on gains/losses relative to a reference point

### 1.c Risk aversion and loss aversion
- A person who is risk averse prefers *the expected value of a prospect* to the prospect itself, whereas for a person who is loss averse, losses *loom larger* than gains.

### 1.d Weighting function and event probability
- Event probability is simply the subjective view on how likely the event is
- the weighting function is associated with the probability of an outcome, but is *not strictly the same* as the probability as in expected utility theory

> Key Aspects:
> 1. People sometimes exhibit risk aversion and sometimes risk seeking, depening on the nature of the prospect
> 2. Valuations of prospects depend on gains and losses relvative to a reference point
> 3. People are averse to losses because losses loom larger tha gains

### 2*. Give an example of a decision where loss aversion could lead an investor to make an irrational choice. How could this situation be mitigated?

- An investor might be *hesitant* to *sell an underperforming stock* due to loss aversion - the fear of *relaising a loss is psychologicall impactful*
- - holding onto the stock could lead to greater losses
- This could be mitigated through setting *predetermined selling points* (stop-loss orders) to limit potential losses and remove emotional decision-making


### 6*. How might an understanding of loss aversion and risk aversion influence the strategies of a financial advisor when advising clients?

- A financial advisor, understanding these principles might recommend diversified portfolios to risk-averse clients to *spread their risk*.
- and might use methods like *dollar-cost averaging* to mitigate the emotional impact of market fluctuations and loss aversion
- The advisor might also prepare clients for the *inevitability of market downturns* to help them *avoid panic selling* due to loss aversion

> - Dollar cost averaging: by investing in smaller set amounts over time, will buy both when prices are low and high. Smoothes out average purchase price. Can be especially powerful in recessions and bear markets.
