# Tutorial 9
# Behavioural Explanations for Anomalies 

### 1*. Differentiate the following terms/concepts:
**a. Momentum and reversal**

- Momentum is positive correlation in returns, exist empirically over the medium term
- Reversal is a negative correlation in returns, the latter over the long term
> - Should be no overvalued or undervalued stocks

**b. Mean-reversion and continuation scenarios in the Barberis-Shleifer-Vishny (BSV) model**

- Investors expect positive/negative surprised to be followed by negative/positive surprises
- Under continuation, investors expect a positive/negative surprises to be followed by positive/negative surprises

**c. Size factor and book-to-market factor**

- In Fama french thee factor model, size and book-to-market are risk factors

> - Two risk factors still being incorporated into the model
> - Come up with more factors that could influence stock returns
> 

d. Risk-based and behavioural explanations (for anomalies)

- A risk based (ration) explanation would argue that value stocks to better on average because they are riskier as in the Fama French model
- Behavioural model would say that anomalies exist because of investor error & limits of arbitrage

> - Arbitrage exists because of the limits to arbitrage


### 2*. In the context of the BSV model, explain intuitively (nontechnically) why two consecutive earnings changes in the same direction make investors less likely to think that they are in regime 1 (mean-reversion) vs. the case of two earnings changes in alternate directions

- In regime 1, it is believe earnings mean-revert
  - given a positive/negative earnings change, there is a low probability of another earnings chnage


- In regime 2, given a poitive/negative earning change, there is a probability of another positive/negative earnings changes in the next period
  - continuation in earnings
- two consecutive earnings means 


### 5*. Momentum is the anomaly that gives those subscribing to efficient markets the most trouble. Explain.

- Fama Frnech three-factor model has a role for size and value but not momentum
- Some research related momentum to business cycle and the state of the market
  - non-diversifiable macroeconomic instruments account for a large portion of momentum profits
- time-varying CAPM with beta uncertainty can contribute to an explanation of momentum

### 6*. A series of Questions related to Factor Zoos:

**(a) What is Factor Zoo?**

- The factor Zoo is a term used in the context

(b) What is the development of academic research related to the “Factor Zoo”?

- landscape of asset pricing factors is complex, hundred of proposed factors
- leading researching have raised concerns  about legitimacy
  - Use data minings and find and explain anomalies


### CFA question

- home bias may influence investor behaviour
- 
- Rather than doing thorough analysis, they might anchor to other analysis

- Moderately risk averse, risk averse bias
- Use the tax return to do travel, etc.
- Bad situations, mental accounting bias
- For the investor, mental accounting bias

Portfolio 2 has the same returns and sharpe ratios 

Mental account bias
- most likely select portfolio 2
- Suggests that he wants to compartmentalize his portfolio into discrete layers of low-risk assets verses risky assets without regards to the correlations among the assets

- some clients will view allocation 1 as the more profitable 1
- Prefer allocation 1, anything happens to 
- Result of framing bias, likely to choose an allocation based on a 1/n naive diversification strategy
- As a result of regret bias, likely to coose a conditional 1/n strategy to minimise any potential future regret from one of her funds outperforming another
- Would most likely select AllocationA
  - Ly believe that Calderon exhibits framing and regret biases
