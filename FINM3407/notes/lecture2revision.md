# 1 Introduction to Prospect Theory

- Prospect theory was developed by two psychologists, **Kahneman and Tversky (1979)** based on <u>observing actual behaviour</u> (aka. Positive model).
- Experimental evidence suggests that individuals frequently <u>deviate from the behavioural predictions of expected utility theory</u> (Normative model).
- Prospect theory has a solid mathematical basis. 
- Unlike expected utility theory which concerns itself with how decisions under uncertainty should be made (a prescriptive approach), prospect theory concerns itself with how decisions are actually made (a descriptive approach)
