# 1 Introduction to Prospect Theory

- Prospect theory was developed by two psychologists, **Kahneman and Tversky (1979)** based on <u>observing actual behaviour</u> (aka. Positive model).
- Experimental evidence suggests that individuals frequently <u>deviate from the behavioural predictions of expected utility theory</u> (Normative model).
- Prospect theory has a solid mathematical basis. 
- Unlike expected utility theory which concerns itself with how decisions under uncertainty should be made (a prescriptive approach), prospect theory concerns itself with how decisions are actually made (a descriptive approach)

### Recap:

- Expected Utility can be defined as:

$$E(U) = \sum^{N}_{i=1}P_{i}U(w_{i})$$

Where:
- $P_{i}$ - probability of each outcome
- $U(w_{i})$ is the utility derived from each outcome ($w_{i}$ = wealth)

**Example:**
- If you face this gambling opportunity: 50% win $105, 50% lose $100. Take it?
- If you are an expected utility maximizer with wealth W, you should take the gamble if
current utility < expected utility
  - expected outcome - $2.5
- Von Neumann and Morgenstern 
  - if you follow certain axioms, you must maximize “expected utility.”

### Loss Aversion vs Risk Aversion

**Loss Aversion** | **Risk Aversion**
 | --- | --- | 
 Strong preference to avoid losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. <br> - Feelings of loss are psychologically about twice as powerful as feelings of gain. <br> - May lead to taking bigger risks to avoid losses. | - Preference for lower levels of risk and uncertainty.<br> - Choice of guaranteed outcomes, even if less profitable.<br> - Drives decisions towards certainty over uncertainty.

### Development of prospect theory
- The prospect theory was proposed in 1979 to address certain empirical observations that Expected Utility Theory failed to explain.
  - Value vs. Utility & Difference in Wealth vs. Total Wealth 

Three Key characteristics of the value function include:
1. Reference Dependence: Value perception is relative to a specific reference point, typically the status quo.
2. Loss Aversion: Losses impact utility more than equivalent gains.
$$v(x) < -v(-x)$$
3. Diminishing Sensitivity: Sensitivity to wealth changes decreases as the magnitude of gain or loss increases.

### Common value functional form of Prospect Theory

**Positive Domain**
$$v(z) = z \alpha  \; \text{for} \; z≥0, \; \; 0< \alpha <1  $$

- $z$ is change in wealth (horizontal line)
- Value function (not utility) so $v$ is used.
