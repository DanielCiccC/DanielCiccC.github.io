## Risk and Uncertainty
- Risk is when you know what the outcomes could be, **and can assign probabilities**
- Uncertainty is when you can’t assign probabilities; or you can’t come up with a list of possible outcomes

## Loss Aversion
- Losses loom **greater** than gains. 
- Strong preference to avoid losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains.

### Examples/manifestations
- Not selling a stock when your current rational analysis of the stock clearly indicates that it should be abandoned as an investment.
- Selling a stock that has gone slightly up in price just to realize a gain of any amount, when your analysis indicates that the stock should be held longer for a much larger profit [Disposition effect].
- Prevent a company from discontinuing a failing product line or from investing in a promising but uncertain venture. 

### Mitigate effect
- Setting *predetermined selling points* (stop-loss orders) to limit potential losses and remove emotional decision-making
- methods like *dollar-cost averaging* to mitigate the emotional impact of market fluctuations and loss aversion
- prepare clients for the *inevitability of market downturns* to help them *avoid panic selling* due to loss aversion

## Risk Aversion
- A person who is risk averse prefers *the expected value of a prospect* to the prospect itself
- Preference for lower levels of risk and uncertainty.
- Risk-averse: $U(E(w)) > U(P)$

### Examples/manifestations
- prefer investments with lower but more certain returns, such as bonds or index funds. 
- Lead a company to retain excess cash reserves or avoid taking on debt, even when those resources could be invested profitably. 

## Risk Seeking
- Risk seeking describes someone who prefers a lottery to the expected value of a lottery.

### Examples/manifestations
- risk-seeking individual might invest more heavily in high-risk, high-reward assets, like individual stocks or cryptocurrencies. 


## Representative
- People frequently make the mistake of believing that two similar things or events are more closely correlated than they actually are.
- Judging the likelihood of things in terms of how well they seem to represent, or match, particular prototypes.

## Lottery and Insurance
- A lottery is a prospect with a low probability of a high payoff.  Many people buy lottery tickets, even with negative expected values.  These same people buy insurance to protect themselves from risk.
- Normally, insurance is a hedge against a low-probability large loss. These choices are inconsistent with traditional expected utility framework but can be explained by prospect theory. 

## Mental Accounting
- Individuals classify money differently based on subject criteria.

### Related
- integration/segregation

## Fear of Regret
- Make decisions based on minimising the possibility of experiencing regret in the future, even if it means avoiding potential opportunities or taking risks. 

> May be a conservative investor; invest in other stock/security for fear of missing out despite obvious risks
> - Similar to FOMO 


## Integration/segregation
- Integration occurs when positions are *lumped together*
- Segregation occurs when situations are *viewed one at a time*

## Silver lining effect
- They tend to mentally combine wins but separate losses to make them feel less impactful.

## House money effect
- People tend to be more willing to gamble with money that they have won (house money) than with their initial stake or with money won in earlier rounds of betting.

- segregation vs integration 

## Overconfidence
Overconfidence: unwarranted faith in one’s intuitive reasoning, judgments, and cognitive abilities.

### Strains of overconfidence
**Miscalibration**
- tendency for people to overestimate the precision of their knowledge

Measuring Miscalibration
- Calibration tests
  -  how many you though you answered correctly
- Confidence interval approach
  - Confidence interval: an interval that is expected to contain the parameter being estimated

**Better-than-average effect**

Refers to the tendency for a person to rate themselves as above average.
- Many of us feel we are smarter or more skilled than average, but only 50% of us can really be better than average.


**Illusion of control**
The tendency to think that there is more control over events than can objectively be true
- For example, gamblers may think that they can control the outcome of the dice or the cards, or people actually believe that the risk of infection is partly a function of the character of the person that they are coming into contact with.

**Excessive optimism**
- Reflects the feeling that things will be rosier than objective analysis suggests.
- When people’s predictions about the future are unrealistically optimistic.
- Students  expect  to  receive  higher  marks  than they actually receive.
- Overestimates the number of job offers that they will receive.
- People think they can accomplish more than they actually end up accomplishing.
- RELATED - miscalibration

### Impacts/Implications
1.  Unfounded belief in own ability to identify companies as potential investments: blind to any negative information 
2. Excessive trading: lower returns 
3. Underestimating their downside risks: surprise on underperformance 
4. Portfolio under diversification: taking on more risk 
    - overconfidence is the driving force behind both excessive trading and under-diversification


### Mitigate effect
1.  Review trading records of past two years and then calculate the performance of your trades. 
2. keep track of each and every investment trade and then calculate the returns.
3. (1) review investment holdings for potential poor performance; (2) realized how volatile the markets are 
4. recall that numerous, once-great companies have fallen; what is the optimal portfolio without current holdings?

## Self-attribution Bias
- A reason impeding overconfidence
- The tendency to attribute successes to one's own abilities, while blaming failures on circumstances beyond one's control (forget our defeats)

## Hindsight Bias
- Says we knew what was going to happen when we really didn’t.

### Related concepts
- related to bubbles


## Confirmation Bias
- the tendency to search out evidence consistent with one’s prior beliefs and to ignore conflicting data.

1. Overinvestment
2. Higher Sensitivity of Investment to Cashflows
3. More Active in M&A
4. Too Quick to Start New Businesses

# Concepts

### Agency Costs
- **Direct costs:** expenditures that benefit the managers but not the firms & costs arise from monitoring management actions
  - Example: the cost of hiring outside auditors, business trips using a private jet instead of commercial flights
- **Indirect costs:** results from lost opportunities
Example: managers of a firm that is an acquisition target may resist the takeover attempt because of concern about keeping their jobs, even if the shareholders would benefit from the merger.

### EMH forms
- Weak form market efficiency prices reflect all the information contained in historical returns.  
- With semi-strong form market efficiency prices reflect all publicly available information. 
- Strong form market efficiency prices reflect information that is not publicly available, such as insiders’ information.

### Random Walk vs Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Burton Malkiel: Yes, Random walk ➔ Efficient market hypothesis 
- Richard Thaler says: No, Random walk $\ne$ Efficient market hypothesis
  - (1) Prices generated by noise traders could be random but could be deviated from the fundamental value.
  - large enough group of noise traders can form a sentiment and can influence the market
  - (1) Prices are right (EMH) ➔ No free lunch (no arbitrage opportunity)
  - (2) No free lunch $\ne$ Prices are right (EMH)

### Non-linear weighting function

### CAPM, expected return and CML/SML

### EMH and implications
Market efficiency requires that only one of the following three conditions need hold:
1. Universal rationality
2. Uncorrelated errors
3. Unlimited arbitrage

- If the first holds, prices will be on average right and markets will be efficient. 
- If the first does not hold, but the second does hold, while errors will be made, once again on average prices will be right. 
- If the first two do not hold, but the third does hold, while prices have the potential to diverge from value because errors are often one-sided, arbitrageurs will notice such opportunities and swiftly take action so as to eliminate mispricing.

### Limits to Arbitrage
1) Fundamental Risk
- If you think a stock is underpriced you can buy it, but:
  - You might be sideswiped by the market.
  - Or maybe by the industry.
  - Plus, there is idiosyncratic risk.
2) Noise Trader risk
Real world arbitrageurs cannot wait it out because as professional money managers they do not have long horizons – they are usually evaluated at least at once per year.
3) Implementation costs
- In some cases, horizon is short but short-selling is:
  - Expensive (commissions, spreads, price impact & fees for shorting stock)
  - Difficult or even impossible (lack of availability regardless of fees; legal factors: many institutions cannot short)

### Fundamental risk and noise-trader risk
- Fundamental risk arises because of the potential for *rational revaluation as new information arrives* and
- Noise-trader risk arises because mispricing can be *more severe in the short turn*. Some people may not be happy

## Managerial Ease of Processing
- Conventional finance theory demonstrates that, when properly applied, NPV is optimal decision rule for capital budgeting purposes. 
- Yet a number of surveys show that managers often utilise less than ideal techniques, such as the internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period

### Managerial Overconfidence tendencies
1. Overinvestment
- Unfounded belief in own ability to identify companies
- Overconfident managers invest more
2. Higher Sensitivity of Investment to Cashflows
- Overinvestment when free cash is available
- Asymmetric information view - acting in the best interests of shareholders and noticing that the company’s shares are undervalued will not issue new shares to undertake investment projects.
3. More Active in M&A
- Survey evidence documents that overconfident managers appear to be more active on the M&A front
4. Too Quick to Start New Businesses
- Excessive optimism: overestimation of market demand.
- Better-than-average effect: “I will beat the odds.”

### Managerial Overconfidence Positive aspects
- optimism about future cash flows leads to a belief that there will be little problem in covering interest payments
- entrepreneurial activity can provide valuable information to society. Provides valuable evolutionary purpose
