<h2 dir="auto" id="part-one-application-to-managerial-overconfidence">Part One: Application to Managerial Overconfidence</h2>
<h3 dir="auto" id="1-differentiate-the-following-termsconcepts">1*. Differentiate the following terms/concepts:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>a.  Payback and NPV:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Payback is how long it takes for an investment to return its outlay in cashflows without regard
for time value.</li>
<li dir="auto">NPV properly takes into account time value by discounting all positive and negative cash flows and summing them up.  A positive-NPV project, since it adds value, should be adopted.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>b.  Holding in-the-money options too long and engaging in frequent acquisitions:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">These are both proxies for managerial overconfidence.</p>
<p dir="auto">Overconfident managers, thinking that their firms will perform well in the future, are happy to expose themselves to own-firm-specific risk even when diversification gains are available.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">CEOs often receive stock and option grants as compensation.  This is done so that shareholders’ and managers’ interests are aligned.  While there are limitations as to when options can be exercised, at some point managers do have the ability to exercise them.</li>
<li dir="auto">One metric that can be used for overconfidence is the tendency to voluntarily hold a large number of in-the-money options (that optimally from the standpoint of diversification gains should be exercised but that are still being held).</li>
<li dir="auto">A second metric that has been used for overconfidence in managers is engaging in frequent acquisitions. The argument is that only egregiously overconfident managers engage in a spate of deals within a short period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>c.  Random treatment and self-selection treatment in Camerer and Lovallo experiment:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In the Camerer and Lovallo experiment in one treatment individuals knew that payoffs would be  a  function  of  skill.  Those  volunteering  to  participate  were  thus  self-selecting  into  this treatment vs. the random treatment where no information was given before the fact.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>d. Risk aversion and overconfidence in debt issuance:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">These two factors are likely to create conflicting effects when it comes to debt issuance.</p>
<p dir="auto">In one model otherwise rational managers are not only excessively optimistic about their firm’s prospects but also overly sure about their views. This model suggests that managerial overconfidence is positively correlated with debt issuance, because optimism about future cashflows leads to a belief that there will be little problem in covering interest payments.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ironically, the natural tendency to shy away from debt because of job concerns (which is value-
destroying because the benefits of debt are not exhausted) is counteracted by overconfidence.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="2-investment-activity-is-driven-by-both-rational-value-maximization-and-behavioral-influences-on-the-part-of-managers-discuss">2*.  Investment  activity  is  driven  by  both  rational  value-maximization  and  behavioral influences on the part of managers.  Discuss.</h3>
<p dir="auto">Investments that are objectively a positive-NPV propositions are always wise.  In this chapter it was suggested that overconfidence on the part of managers could also lead to investment.  Survey evidence indicates that overconfident CEOs invest more.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also evidence that the  investment  strategy  of  overconfident  managers  can  be  suboptimal,  with  overconfident managers being too quick to engage in acquisitions as well as being overly sensitive to the availability of free cashflows.</p>

<p dir="auto">A total profit of $50 is split between all entrants up to c=2. So at E=2, industry profit is
maximized (at $50).  Additional entrants lose $10.  If everybody enters (E=10) industry profit
is minimized.  The first two entrants earn $50 in aggregate and the next 8 lose $10 each.  The
total industry profit is $50 – (8 * -$10) = -$30.  If only 7 enter, industry profit is zero, because
$50 – ((7-5) * -$10) = $0.</p>

In the Camerer and Lovallo experiment, overconfidence leads to excessive entry into markets.  Do you believe that if a prospective entrepreneur read this research, she would be more or less likely to undertake a start-up?  Explain.</h3>
<p dir="auto">Not necessarily.  An overconfident entrepreneur would think the research is about anybody but
him/her.  Consistent with this, in chapter 18, we present evidence that debiasing is a very
difficult undertaking.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="the-following-information-related-to-cfa-question-1---7">The following information related to CFA Question 1 - 7</h3>
<p dir="auto">Tiffany Jordan is a hedge fund manager with a history of outstanding performance. For the past 10 years, Jordan’s fund has used an equity market neutral strategy (long/ short strategy that strives to eliminate market risk, i.e., beta should be zero) which has proved to be effective as a result of Jordan’s hard work. An equity market neutral strategy normally <em>generates large daily trading volume</em> and shifts in individual security positions. Jordan’s reputation has grown over the years as her fund has consistently beaten its benchmark. Employee turnover on Jordan’s team has been high; <em>she has a tendency to be quick to blame, and rarely gives credit to team members  for  success</em>.  During  the  past  twelve  months,  her  fund  has  been  significantly underperforming against its benchmark.  One of Jordan’s junior analysts, Jeremy Tang, is concerned about the underperformance and notes the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Observation 1: Certain positions are <em>significantly under water</em>, have much higher risk
profiles, and have been held for much longer than normal.</li>
<li dir="auto">Observation 2: The trading volume of the fund has decreased by more than 40 percent
during the past year.</li>
<li dir="auto">Observation 3: The portfolio is more concentrated in a few sectors than in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Tang is worried that the portfolio may be in violation of the fund’s Investment Policy Statement (IPS). Tang brings this to Jordan’s attention during a <em>regular weekly team meeting</em>. Jordan dismisses Tang’s analysis and tells the team not to worry because she knows what she is doing. Jordan  indicates  that  since  she  believes  the  pricing  misalignment  will  correct  itself,  the portfolio will not be able to take advantage of the reversion to the mean if she sells certain losing positions. She reassures the team that this strategy has performed well in the past and that the markets will revert, and the fund’s returns will return to normal levels. Tang tactfully suggests that the team review the fund’s IPS together, and Jordan interrupts him and reminds the team that she has memorized the IPS by heart. Tang contemplates his next step. He is  concerned  that Jordan is  displaying behavioral  biases which  are affecting the  fund’s performance.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="by-taking-credit-for-successes-but-assigning-blame-for-failures-jordan-is-most-likely-demonstrating">By taking credit for successes but assigning blame for failures, Jordan is most likely demonstrating:</h3>
<p dir="auto">A. loss-aversion bias.<br>
<strong>B. self-attribution bias.</strong>
C. illusion of knowledge bias.</p>
<p dir="auto">B is correct. Self-attribution is a bias in which people take credit for successes and assign
responsibilities  for  failure.  Jordan  attributes  successful  decisions  to  herself  while  poor
decisions are attributed to the team. Her self-esteem affects how she looks at success and failure.
Self-attribution  and  illusion  of  knowledge  biases  contribute  to  overconfidence  bias,  which
Jordan clearly demonstrates later when she tells the team that she knows what she is doing.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="which-of-tangs-observations-is-least-likely-to-be-the-consequence-of-jordan-demonstrating-loss-aversion-bias">Which of Tang’s observations is least likely to be the consequence of Jordan demonstrating loss-aversion bias?</h3>
<p dir="auto">A. Observation 1.<br>
B. Observation 2.<br>
<strong>C. Observation 3.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">C is  correct. Loss aversion by itself may cause a sector concentration; however, a market
neutral strategy tends to focus on individual stocks without regard to the sector. The sector
exposure would be mitigated with the balancing of the individual long and short positions.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="which-of-jordans-actions-least-supports-that-she-may-be-affected-by-the-illusion-of-control-bias">Which of Jordan’s actions least supports that she may be affected by the illusion of control bias?</h3>
<p dir="auto">A. Her dismissal of Tang’s analysis.<br>
<strong>B. Her routine of holding weekly team meetings.</strong><br>
C. Her comment on market turnaround and current holdings.</p>
<p dir="auto">B is correct. Holding weekly team meetings, which would indicate a willingness to listen to
feedback from others, is not representative of the illusion of control bias. The illusion of control
bias is one in which people believe they can control outcomes. Individuals exhibiting this bias
display great certainty in their predictions of outcomes of chance events and ignore others’
viewpoints. Jordan is sure that the market will turn around even though it is out of her control.
She chooses not to listen to Tang who is questioning her viewpoint.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="how-does-jordan-most-likely-demonstrate-loss-aversion-bias">How does Jordan most likely demonstrate loss-aversion bias?</h3>
<p dir="auto">A. Telling the team not to worry.<br>
B. Reducing the portfolio turnover this year.<br>
<strong>C. Deciding to hold the losing positions until they turn around.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">C is correct. Jordan’s behavior is a classic example of loss aversion: When a loss occurs, she
holds on to these positions longer than warranted. By doing so, Jordan has accepted more risk
in the portfolio. Loss-aversion bias is one in which people exhibit a strong preference to avoid
losses  versus  achieving  gains.  One  of  the  consequences  of  loss  aversion  bias  is  that  the
financial management professional (in this case, Jordan) may hold losing investments in the
hope that they will return to break-even or better.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="which-of-the-following-emotional-biases-has-jordan-most-likely-exhibited">Which of the following emotional biases has Jordan most likely exhibited?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A.  Endowment.</li>
<li dir="auto">B.  Regret aversion.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>C.  Overconfidence.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">C is correct. Jordan exhibits overconfidence in several ways. She ignores the analysis done by
Tang. This may be because Jordan believes she is smarter and more informed than her team
members, which is typical of an individual with an illusion of knowledge bias. The certainty
she demonstrates that the market will revert is evidence of overconfidence. Her overconfidence
is intensified by her self-attribution bias, which is demonstrated through her dealings with her
team when she blames them for losses while taking credit for the gains. Finally, her portfolio’s
underperformance against the benchmark is a consequence of overconfidence bias.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="which-one-of-the-following-biases-did-jordan-not-demonstrate">Which one of the following biases did Jordan not demonstrate?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A. Self-attribution.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>B. Representativeness.</strong></li>
<li dir="auto">C. Illusion of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">B is correct. Nowhere in the scenario did it mention that Jordan classified certain information
into a personalized category. Representativeness bias is a cognitive bias in which people tend
to  classify  new  information  based  on  past  experiences  and  classifications.  Jordan  is  not
relating the certainty about the future or her decision to hold losing positions back to something
she has done or experienced in the past.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="which-of-tangs-findings-is-not-a-typical-consequence-of-self-control-bias">Which of Tang’s findings is not a typical consequence of self-control bias?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A Failure to explore other portfolio opportunities.</strong>
B Asset allocation imbalance problems in the portfolio.
C A higher risk profile in the portfolio due to pursuit of higher returns.</p>
<p dir="auto">A is correct. Failing to explore other opportunities is a demonstration of status quo bias, not
self-control. Self-control bias occurs when individuals deviate from their long-term goals, in
this  case,  the  investment  policy  statement,  due  to  a  lack  of  self-discipline.  Jordan  is  not
adhering to the strategy which has been successful in the past.</p>
<p dir="auto">The consequences of self-control bias  include  accepting  too  much  risk  in  the  portfolio  (C)  and  asset  allocation  imbalance problems (B) as Jordan attempts to generate higher returns.</p>
