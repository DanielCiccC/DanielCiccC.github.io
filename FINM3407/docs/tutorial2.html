<h3 dir="auto" id="11-lottery-and-insurance">1.1 Lottery and Insurance</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A lottery is a prospect with a low probability of a high payoff.  Many people buy lottery tickets, even with negative expected values.  These same people buy insurance to protect themselves from risk.</li>
<li dir="auto">Normally, insurance is a hedge against a low-probability large loss. These choices are inconsistent with traditional expected utility framework but can be explained by prospect theory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="1b-segregation-and-integration">1.b Segregation and integration</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Integration occurs when positions are <em>lumped together</em></li>
<li dir="auto">Segregation occurs when situations are <em>viewed one at a time</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">reference point is the starting point from which people make decisions about gains and losses.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="1c-risk-aversion-and-loss-aversion">1.c Risk aversion and loss aversion</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A person who is risk averse prefers <em>the expected value of a prospect</em> to the prospect itself,</li>
<li dir="auto">For a person who is loss averse, losses <em>loom larger</em> than gains.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="1d-weighting-function-and-event-probability">1.d Weighting function and event probability</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Event probability is simply the subjective view on how likely the event is</li>
<li dir="auto">The weighting function is associated with the probability of an outcome, but is <em>not strictly the same</em> as the probability as in expected utility theory</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Key Aspects:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">People sometimes exhibit risk aversion and sometimes risk seeking, depending on the nature of the prospect</li>
<li dir="auto">Valuations of prospects depend on gains and losses relative to a reference point</li>
<li dir="auto">People are averse to losses because losses loom larger tha gains</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="2-give-an-example-of-a-decision-where-loss-aversion-could-lead-an-investor-to-make-an-irrational-choice-how-could-this-situation-be-mitigated">2*. Give an example of a decision where <em>loss aversion</em> could lead an investor to make an irrational choice. How could this situation be mitigated?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">An investor might be <em>hesitant</em> to <em>sell an underperforming stock</em> due to loss aversion - the fear of <em>realising a loss is psychologically impactful</em></li>
<li dir="auto">Holding onto the stock could lead to greater losses</li>
<li dir="auto">This could be mitigated through setting <em>predetermined selling points</em> (stop-loss orders) to limit potential losses and remove emotional decision-making</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="3-consider-an-individual-who-is-risk-averse-how-might-this-person-behave-differently-in-investment-scenarios-compared-to-a-risk-seeking-individual">3*.  Consider  an  individual  who  is  risk  averse.  How  might  this  person  behave differently in investment scenarios compared to a risk-seeking individual?</h3>
<p dir="auto">A risk-averse individual would prefer investments with lower but more certain returns, such as bonds or index funds. On the other hand, a risk-seeking individual might invest more heavily in high-risk, high-reward assets, like individual stocks or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="4-in-your-own-words-explain-how-loss-aversion-and-risk-aversion-might-influence-a-companys-financial-decision-making">4. In your own words, explain how loss aversion and risk aversion might influence a company's financial decision-making.</h3>
<p dir="auto">Both loss aversion and risk aversion can lead a company to conservative financial decision-making.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Loss aversion might prevent a company from discontinuing a failing product line or from investing in a promising but uncertain venture.</li>
<li dir="auto">Risk aversion might lead a company to retain excess cash reserves or avoid taking on debt, even when those resources could be invested profitably.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="5-can-a-person-be-both-risk-averse-and-loss-averse-give-a-practical-example-of-how-these-two-characteristics-might-interact">5. Can a person be both risk-averse and loss-averse? Give a practical example of how these two characteristics might interact.</h3>
<p dir="auto">Yes, a person can be both risk-averse and loss-averse. For example, an investor might choose a low-risk investment portfolio to avoid the potential for large losses (risk aversion) but might also hold onto an underperforming stock to avoid realizing a loss (loss aversion).</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="6-how-might-an-understanding-of-loss-aversion-and-risk-aversion-influence-the-strategies-of-a-financial-advisor-when-advising-clients">6*. How might an understanding of loss aversion and risk aversion influence the strategies of a financial advisor when advising clients?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A financial advisor, understanding these principles might recommend diversified portfolios to risk-averse clients to <em>spread their risk</em>.</li>
<li dir="auto">and might use methods like <em>dollar-cost averaging</em> to mitigate the emotional impact of market fluctuations and loss aversion</li>
<li dir="auto">The advisor might also prepare clients for the <em>inevitability of market downturns</em> to help them <em>avoid panic selling</em> due to loss aversion</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Dollar cost averaging: by investing in smaller set amounts over time, will buy both when prices are low and high. Smoothes out average purchase price. Can be especially powerful in recessions and bear markets.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>c. Are these choices consistent with expected utility theory?  Why or why not?</strong>
Violation  of  EU  theory  because  preferences  are  inconsistent.    The  same  sort  of  Allais paradox proof from Chapter 1 can be used.  It is also necessary to make the assumption of preference homogeneity, which means that if D is preferred to C, it will also be true that D* is preferred to C* where these are:</p>
