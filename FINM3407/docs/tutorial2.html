<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A financial advisor, understanding these principles might recommend diversified portfolios to risk-averse clients to <em>spread their risk</em>.</li>
<li dir="auto">and might use methods like <em>dollar-cost averaging</em> to mitigate the emotional impact of market fluctuations and loss aversion</li>
<li dir="auto">The advisor might also prepare clients for the <em>inevitability of market downturns</em> to help them <em>avoid panic selling</em> due to loss aversion</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Dollar cost averaging: by investing in smaller set amounts over time, will buy both when prices are low and high. Smoothes out average purchase price. Can be especially powerful in recessions and bear markets.</li>
