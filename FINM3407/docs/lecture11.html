<li dir="auto">We argued that behavioral considerations can contribute to an understanding of certain anomalies in the pricing of individual stocks.</li>
<li dir="auto">There we took a cross-sectional (or individual stock) approach. If we aggregate the market values of all stocks in the market, we have the aggregate value of the stock market.</li>
<li dir="auto">It turns out that, just as there are cross-sectional anomalies, there are also aggregate stock market puzzles.</li>

<li dir="auto">The difference between expected equity return and fixed-income return is known as equity premium.</li>
<li dir="auto">The equity premium is defined to be the gap between the expected return on the aggregate stock market and a portfolio of fixed-income securities.</li>
<li dir="auto">On this basis, the equity premium can be calculated in a number of ways:

<p dir="auto">Many theorists believe equity premium is too large for actual risk.
Especially clear when we look at longer horizons:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">At longer horizons stocks almost always outperform, plus risk of stocks declines more quickly than would be expected.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Risk vs. Returns:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Stocks are inherently riskier ‚Üí higher expected
returns.</li>
<li dir="auto">However, the observed equity premium contradicts
conventional wisdom on risk preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Expected Utility Theory:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Implies an unreasonably high-risk aversion to justify
observed returns.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Mehra &amp; Prescott Argument:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Equity Premium with reasonable risk aversion = 0.1%</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Typical value from logarithmic utility function:

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Mental accounting involves categorising financial information into distinct and manageable blocks.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">This method impacts how individuals evaluate and perceive their financial data. Often, people don't scrutinise their portfolios continuously, leading to passive oversight of short-term gains or losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">However, periodic reviews make them more aware of their financial performance. At these moments, they might &quot;book their losses,&quot; essentially separating past financial decisions from future ones.

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Myopic Loss Aversion: investors focus too much on short-term losses while ignoring potential long-term gains</li>
<li dir="auto">Key is to remember loss aversion (investors hate losing money) and to consider how often investors evaluate their portfolios</li>

you find stocks very risky.</li>

observed market risk premium?</p>

careful look.</p>

<p dir="auto">In some experiments, two assets are traded in order to investigate whether pricing differs across the
assets.<br>
One study allowed trading of two assets: a standard asset and a ‚Äúlottery‚Äù asset.
Second asset is referred to as lottery asset because its payoffs are similar to a lottery.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Payoff usually zero, but 4% of the time asset earns large dividend payment of $18.00</li>

<li dir="auto">Implication: Trillions of dollars in stock market value evaporated
during this short time frame, signifying one of the most intense
periods of market volatility and downturns.</li>
<li dir="auto">Market  Reaction:  Despite  significant  negative  events  in
September 2008, the market remained stable during that week,
potentially  due  to  the  anticipation  of  government  intervention
(like  the  bailout).  However,  the  optimism  was  short-lived,  and
the market soon witnessed one of its most profound downturns.
This  interpretation  summarizes  the  movement  of  the  S&amp;P  500
during  a  critical  period  of  the  2007-2008  financial  crisis,
highlighting  the  market's  extreme  vulnerability  and  the  rapid
erosion of investor wealth.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The equity premium is the difference between the expected returns on equity and debt. The high level of the premium is puzzling
because it seems to require very high-risk aversion.</li>
<li dir="auto">Survivorship bias refers to the tendency to get biased results because failed observations are excluded from the sample over time.
This may explain the equity premium.</li>
<li dir="auto">Loss aversion, combined with mental accounting and so-called myopic loss aversion, can explain why investors require a large
premium on equity.</li>
<li dir="auto">A  speculative  bubble  is  present  in  a  market  when  high  prices  seem  to  be  generated  more  by  traders‚Äô  enthusiasm  than  by
economic fundamentals.</li>
<li dir="auto">Price bubbles are observed in diverse markets. For example, during the tulip mania, people traded large sums of money and goods
for tulip bulbs.</li>
<li dir="auto">According to the greater fool theory, a person buys an asset because he believes another will pay even more to acquire it.</li>
<li dir="auto">In  the  1990s,  the  entire  U.S.  market  seems  to  have  deviated  far  from  valuations  based  on  economic  fundamentals.  The
technology sector was affected most dramatically.</li>
<li dir="auto">‚ÄúIrrational exuberance‚Äù is a term used to describe the U.S. stock market by Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan in the 1990s.</li>
<li dir="auto">Extremely high price-to-earnings ratios were explained by ‚Äúnew era‚Äù arguments</li>
<li dir="auto">Survey data indicate that a majority of individual and institutional investors thought the market was overvalued in 1999.</li>
<li dir="auto">In  experimental bubbles  markets,  assets  are  traded  over  a  fixed  number  of  periods  and  traders  can  easily  compute  expected
fundamental values.</li>
<li dir="auto">Prices in experiments typically bubble high above the fundamental value, crashing down as the end of trading approaches.</li>
<li dir="auto">Bubbles moderate when a subset of traders is knowledgeable and experienced, there is not too much cash in the market, and
short sales are permitted.</li>
<li dir="auto">The generation of price bubbles is encouraged by probability judgment error and speculation.</li>
<li dir="auto">Stock prices are too volatile to be explained by future dividends.</li>
<li dir="auto">Volatility is higher for technology firms and the level of volatility is increasing, as is the difference in volatility across the S&amp;P 500
and Nasdaq.</li>
<li dir="auto">The VIX, or fear index, gauges investors‚Äô expectations of future stock market volatility using current option prices. In recent months,
the VIX rose to unprecedented levels.</li>
<li dir="auto">Beginning in 2007, markets were gripped by a liquidity crisis. Potential contributing factors included the large risky positions taken
by financial institutions, easy lending practices, and the perception that credit default risk was high.</li>
