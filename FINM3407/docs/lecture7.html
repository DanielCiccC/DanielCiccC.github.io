<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Conventional finance theory demonstrates that, when properly applied, NPV is optimal decision rule for capital
budgeting purposes.</li>
<li dir="auto">Yet a number of surveys show that managers often utilise less than ideal techniques, such as the internal rate of
return (IRR) and, even worse, payback period (e.g. Graham &amp; Harvey, 2005).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Latter two may be easier to process and more salient. For this reason, they may be compelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The desirability of getting your money back quickly (as reflected in payback) is obvious to even the most unsophisticated observer, though many do not realise that any payback benchmark can only be arbitrary.</li>
<li dir="auto">Somewhat less intuitive is IRR, but a comparison between the project’s estimated return and its cost of capital is still quite compelling.</li>
<li dir="auto">NPV, which is all about value creation, is perhaps a harder concept to grasp. So, it is possible that psychology is playing a role in the sometimes-weak capital budgeting technique choices that are made.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">NPV gives you the correct value</li>
<li dir="auto">With unconventional cash flows, deciding on the scale of the project, IRR is not the best
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">does not consider the size of the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">NPV gives the dollar return</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="allowing-sunk-costs-to-influence-the-abandonment-decision">Allowing Sunk Costs to Influence the Abandonment Decision</h3>
<p dir="auto">Capital budgeting and loss aversion</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Mental accounting suggests that if an account can be kept open in the hope of eventually turning things around this will often be done.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Say prior investment has not gone well.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Proper capital budgeting practice is to periodically assess the viability of all current investments, even proceeding with their abandonment when this is a value-enhancing course of action.</li>
<li dir="auto">Problem with abandonment however is that it forces recognition of an ex-post mistake.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Because of loss aversion, it may happen that managers foolishly hang on, throwing good money after bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Allowing sunk cost to influence our decisions</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The market seems to sense the problem.</li>
<li dir="auto">One study indicates that announcements of project terminations are usually well received.</li>
<li dir="auto">Well-known example: Lockheed and its L-1011 airplane project (which the government ended up bailing out). When the firm eventually announced abandonment, the market pushed up its stock price by 18%.</li>
<li dir="auto">High  personal  responsibility  in  the  original  investment  decision  increases  the  resistance  to  project abandonment. This seems to be due to the greater regret that would be induced by “admitting defeat,” as compared to the feeling of cutting losses and getting back on track that a new manager without the same level of emotional commitment to the project would feel.</li>
<li dir="auto">A takeover can facilitate such fresh thinking.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Market knows psychological bias</li>
<li dir="auto">Any negative news, market should react negatively</li>
<li dir="auto">Should start seeing the price decrease</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Economic impact of ending the lockheed project would be too much</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">If you were the person who initiated the project (personal involvement) is high, hard for you to terminate the project</li>
</ul>

<h3 dir="auto" id="allowing-affect-to-influence-choices">Allowing Affect to Influence Choices</h3>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Is it possible that emotion impacts capital budgeting decisions?
Since emotion plays a role in so many other realms, financial and otherwise, it would not be surprising to see it
wield influence here. Direct evidence is likely to be anecdotal at best, since it is not clear how to calibrate a
manager’s emotional state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Hard to get a direct relationship between emotions and decision making</li>
<li dir="auto">Did it through a survey</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto" id="academic-example">Academic Example</h3>
<p dir="auto">Kida, Moreno, and Smith (2001) surveyed a total of 114 managers (or individuals with similar responsibilities).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Presented with one of five treatments where they had to make a choice between two internal investment opportunities.</li>
<li dir="auto">In four of the treatments the choice was between one alternative with a higher NPV and a description inducing negative affect, and a second alternative with a lower NPV but a neutral description.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For  example,  in  scenario  1,  participants  were  told  that  they  were  divisional  managers  deciding  between  two  product investments, each of which would require working with a different sister division run by two different managers.</p>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Gave projects and told have to work with other managers
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">who are potentially arrogant, rude, selfish, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">One  of  the  managers  in  question  was  characterised  as  being arrogant. Financial info of the project, if done with  this individual, would generate a set of cashflows leading  to a higher NPV than the other project.</li>
<li dir="auto">The other three negative affect scenarios were similar in  their attempt to elicit a negative mood or emotion.</li>
<li dir="auto">The final treatment had neutral descriptions attached to  both investment projects.</li>
<li dir="auto">While in the control group the majority of subjects chose  the  higher-yielding  project,  in  all  four  negative  treatments the opposite happened: situations associated  with  negative  affect  were  avoided  to  the  point  of  accepting value destruction.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><img src="assets\IMG42.PNG" alt="alt text" data-src="assets/IMG42.PNG"></p>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Most chose the one with lower NPV</li>

</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto" id="managerial-overconfidence">Managerial Overconfidence</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">It would be surprising if managers of corporations were markedly different from the rest of the population in terms of their overconfidence. Indeed, there is  abundant evidence that managers, like investors, are egregiously overconfident.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey (2007) found that managers tended to predict stronger performance for their operations than actually occurred. Excessive optimism in project cost forecasts is endemic. When CFOs predict market movements, only 40% of realisations fall within 80% confidence intervals.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Found that most of them are overconfident (predict stronger performance)</li>
<li dir="auto">Collaboration and confidence interval test</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The process of CEO selection and monitoring also likely rewards and encourages overconfidence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">There  are  two  forces  here.  First,  generous  executive  compensation  (often  only  weakly  related  to  firm  performance)  signals  success.
Greater overconfidence can result because of associated self-attribution bias. Second, the tendency for boards to be overly deferential and for investors to employ the “Wall Street rule” (sell if unhappy with management) also plays to managerial overconfidence.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Salary compensation is not linking with performance
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Not necessarily for CEO - package is still really high</li>
<li dir="auto">CEO contribute salary to their own success</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Various managerial behaviours have been attributed to overconfidence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">For example, research indicates that overconfident managers <em>tend to miss earnings targets</em> in voluntary forecasts, and, as a result, display a greater proclivity to manage earnings.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey utilised an extensive quarterly survey of CFOs over a six-year period, which, among other things, asked for 90% confidence intervals for 1-year-ahead  and  10-year-ahead market returns, as well as respondents’ optimism levels for the economy and prospects for their own companies.</li>
<li dir="auto">The advantage of this survey is that it elicited two separate overconfidence metrics: one based on miscalibration (which they call overconfidence) and the other based on excessive optimism.</li>
<li dir="auto">(e.g., These researchers then acquired data on the companies for which these CFOs were employed so as to be able to correlate overconfidence metrics with firm-level behaviour.)</li>
<li dir="auto">It was possible to conclude that <strong>overconfident managers invest more</strong>. (In the next section, evidence is presented that the investment strategy of overconfident managers can  be suboptimal.)</li>

<p dir="auto">Two traditional explanations for such investment distortions have been put forth.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Free cash flow problem: It has been suggested that the potential misalignment of managerial and shareholder interests induces overinvestment when free cash is available, as managers are keen to empire build and provide themselves perks.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">General M&amp;A outcome: Acquiring firms don’t seem to benefit their shareholders overall. During the period 1980-2001, $220 billion was lost immediately after bid announcements.</li>
<li dir="auto">Survey evidence documents that overconfident managers appear to be more active on the M&amp;A front.</li>
<li dir="auto">Malmendier and Tate investigate whether naturally occurring data (as opposed to survey data) support this idea, and, if so, whether this increased M&amp;A activity leads to success for the companies.</li>
<li dir="auto">The  impact  of  overconfidence  on  merger  activity  is  not  obvious  or  simple,  because  there  are  two conflicting motivations at play:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">First motivation (encourage mergers), OC managers tend to overestimate the potential synergies and their ability to handle problems that may arise. This makes them more likely to attempt M&amp;A.</li>

<p dir="auto">The market has a sense  of the value destruction  wrought by overconfident managers.

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Aside from obvious potential impacts on investment, capital structure may also be affected. Hackbarth (2007) has formulated a model where otherwise rational managers are not only excessively optimistic about their firm’s prospects, but also overly sure about their views.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">This model suggests that managerial overconfidence is positively correlated with debt issuance, because optimism about future cash flows leads to a belief that there will be little problem in covering interest payments.</li>
<li dir="auto">Ironically, the natural tendency to shy away from debt because of job concerns (which is value-destroying because the benefits of debt are not exhausted) is counteracted by overconfidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">It has even been suggested that overconfidence among entrepreneurs, even if personally deleterious, might be socially beneficial, because entrepreneurial activity can provide valuable information to society (unlike herders, who provide no information). In this sense, it serves a valuable evolutionary purpose.</li>
</ul>

<li dir="auto">Overconfident investors are more willing to take on debt

<h2 dir="auto" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Because of ease of processing, inappropriate capital budgeting techniques may be favored. Because of loss aversion, managers may throw good money after bad. And because of affect, emotion sometimes gets in the way of optimal managerial decision-making.</li>
<li dir="auto">There are many markers (measures) of managerial overconfidence. One is the tendency to hold on to in-the-money options too long.</li>
<li dir="auto">Managerial overconfidence likely leads to various forms of investment distortions or overinvestment.</li>
<li dir="auto">Aside from too much capital spending, overinvestment manifests itself in tendencies toward excessive M&amp;A activity and to be too quick to undertake start-ups.</li>
<li dir="auto">An  example  of  an  investment  distortion  is  allowing  the  availability  of  internal  funds  to  dictate  whether investment should go ahead.</li>
<li dir="auto">Overconfidence may have a bright side, though, in particular because it “corrects” excessive managerial risk aversion.</li>
