<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">May overestimate decisions of his/her knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">excessive optimisms, thinks good things (succeeding in business venture, higher return, job offer)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>b.  Better-than-average effect and illusion of control</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">tendency for a person to rate.fell himself as above average (e.g. smarter)</li>
<li dir="auto">illusion of control, have more control over events than can objectively be true (control the outcome of wealth)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>c.  Self-attribution bias and confirmation bias</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Self-attribution bias; the tendency to attribute successes to one's own abilities, while blaming failures on circumstances beyond one's control (forget our defeats)</li>
<li dir="auto">confirmation biases, tendency to search out evidence consistent with prior beliefs and ignore conflicting data</li>
<li dir="auto">Hindsight bias say we knew what was going to happen when we really didn't (e.g. 'I knew this would happen')</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>d.  Pros and cons of overconfidence</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">predictions are more optimistic when</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">the event forecasted is in the more distant future</li>
<li dir="auto">when a person has committed to a course of action (e.g. practise a lot)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When these conditions are met, excessive optimism may be useful in enhancing performance</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><em>2</em>.  Is miscalibration greater for easy questions or hard questions?  Is it greater when we look at 50% confidence ranges or 98% confidence ranges?</em>*</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">miscalibration tends to be greater for hard questions</li>
<li dir="auto">underconfident in the case of easy questions</li>
<li dir="auto">hard-easy effect</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em><em>4</em>.  Overconfidence does not quickly dissipate via learning because of the existence of contributing biases.  Explain.</em>*</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Existence of overconfidence</li>
<li dir="auto">Self-attribution bias, the tendency for people to attribute successes or good outcomes to their own abilities, while blaiming failures to circumstances beyond their control
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">retards the learning process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">hindsight bias, which pushes people into thinking that 'they knew it all along' Going hand-in-hand with hindsight bias is confirmation bias, the tendency to search out evidence consistent with one's prior beliefs
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Confirmation bias may contribute too</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="5-in-2007-the-new-england-patriots-an-american-football-team-had-a-banner-year-winning-all-16-regular-season-games">5*.  In 2007 the New England Patriots (an American football team) had a banner year winning all 16 regular season games.</h3>
<p dir="auto">In these 16 games their points were: 38, 38, 38, 34, 34, 48, 49, 52, 24, 56, 31, 27, 34, 20, 28, and 38.  Despite this obvious success, their fans were still a bit overconfident going into the playoffs.  The consensus among fans was that they would average 50 points per game in the playoffs.  Plus their fans were 95% sure that they would be within five points of this number (45 to 55).  Illustrate the dimensions of  their  overconfidence.    (For  the  purpose  of  this  question,  assume  the  Patriots participated in four playoff games.)</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Interested in the distribution of the sample mean</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">standard error = 5.09,</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Fair interval = [29.64, 70.36] which is broader than the estimated interval [45, 55].</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">estimated interval is the subset of the fair interval</li>
<li dir="auto">twice as wide as the actual standard deviation of the fans</li>

<h2 dir="auto" id="part-two-impact-of-overconfidence-on-financial-decision-making">Part TWO: Impact of Overconfidence on Financial Decision-making</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Unfounded belief on ability to identify companies as potential investments; blind to any negative information</li>

<li dir="auto">Portfolio under diversification; taking on more risk
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Only put 1 or two stocks in portfolio, which does not created a diversified and safe portfolio</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="1-differentiate-the-following-termsconcepts">1*.  Differentiate the following terms/concepts:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>a.  Indirect and direct tests of relationship between overconfidence and trading activity</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Indirect texts are usually based on trading activity and the fact that theoretical models link overconfidence and trading activity</li>
<li dir="auto">Direct tests are usually experimental (studies from surveys and the lab) and provides a direct link between overconfidence and trading activity</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>b.  Sensation seeking and overconfidence</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">sensation sekking is a personality trait whose four dimensions are</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Thrill and adventure seeking (a desire to engage in thrilling an even dangerous activities)</li>
<li dir="auto">Experience seeking (desire to have new and exciting experiences)</li>
<li dir="auto">Disinhibition (behaviours associated will loss of social inhibitions)</li>
<li dir="auto">Boredom susceptibility (i.e. dislike of repetition of experience)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Overconfidence in its various manifestations has been extensively discussed in this chapter
<strong>c.  Under diversification and excessive trading</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">underdiversification is holding too few securities in your portfolio, so that most gains from diversification are not achieved</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Trading is also excessive when it leads to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>d.  Statics and dynamics of overconfidence</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Right now most people would be judged overconfident if they were tested. This is a snapshot (or statics) issues</li>
<li dir="auto">The question is whether people become less or more overconfident over time</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="2-consider-two-investors-a-and-b-with-the-following-demand-curves-for-a-stock">2*.  Consider two investors (A and B) with the following demand curves for a stock:</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A: p = 100 - q</li>
<li dir="auto">B: p = 150 – 2q</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">-&gt; based on demand curves, investor A</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="3-discuss-what-the-evidence-using-naturally-occurring-data-survey-data-and-experimental-data-suggests-about-the-relationship-among-overconfidence-trading-activity-and-portfolio-performance">3*. Discuss what the evidence (using naturally-occurring data, survey data, and experimental data) suggests about the relationship among overconfidence, trading activity, and portfolio performance.</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">most of the evidence suggests that overconfidence leads to greater trading activity</li>
<li dir="auto">It is the appropriate to use the word 'excessive' because this trading leads to poorer portfolio performance</li>
<li dir="auto">Evidence is mixed on what</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="4-what-evidence-is-there-that-people-do-not-diversify-enough-why-is-it-that-this-occurs-what-is-the-simplest-way-to-buy-a-high-level-of-diversification-in-an-equity-portfolio">4*. What evidence is there that people do not diversify enough?  Why is it that this occurs?  What is the simplest way to “buy” a high level of diversification in an equity portfolio?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">In one study 3,000 US individual portfolios were examined. Most held no stock at all</li>
<li dir="auto">Of the households which did hold stock, (more than 600) it was found that the median number of stocks in portfolios was only one.</li>
<li dir="auto">about 5% of stock-holding households held 10 or more stocks</li>
<li dir="auto">most evidences says that to achieve a reasonable level of diversification, one has to hold more than 10 different stocks (preferably in different sectors of the economy)</li>
<li dir="auto">Some have linked under-diversification to overconfidence
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Those who trade more also tended to be the least diversified</li>
<li dir="auto">It is arguable that this is because overconfidence is the driving force behind both excessive trading and under-diversification</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">market experience made overconfidence worse, which is more consistent with a 'learning to become overconfident' view and self-attribution
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Not going to believe that you are going to make mistakes</li>
