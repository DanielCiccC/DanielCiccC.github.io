<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">It has been argued that a number of anomalies, once reported in the academic literature, either attenuate or disappear in the future.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Anomaly dissipation is exactly what one would expect to see happen in a world which, while not always perfectly efficient, has a tendency to move in that direction once information is disseminated leading to remedial arbitrage activity.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">But those anomalies that have been argued to be risk factors, in particular value and firm size, should not disappear…</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Because, under a risk story, they are not anomalies at all</li>
<li dir="auto">But rather fair compensation for risk borne</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p dir="auto">While value advantage did decline in late 90s, it did come back with a vengeance with bursting of tech/internet bubble beginning in 2000.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="peer-group-evaluation">Peer Group Evaluation</h3>
<p dir="auto">Becoming commonplace for managers to be evaluated relative to their size/value peer group --
relative to their style-peer group.
Style is usually defined in terms of firm size and growth vs. value.

• Managers compared to other managers in their box

<p dir="auto">Consideration of style in portfolio formation can mean different things:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Given that style returns are cyclical, gains in risk reduction can be obtained by consciously diversifying over different styles</li>
<li dir="auto">Within this diversification approach, given that historically value has outperformed growth, and small-cap has outperformed large-cap, it may be advisable to tilt towards small-cap and value, while still investing in different styles</li>

<li dir="auto">Now a large number of conditioning variables used.</li>
<li dir="auto">Variables grouped into five categories: 1/risk; 2/liquidity; 3/price level; 4/growth potential; and 5/technical.</li>
</ul>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Risk factors include such standard risk factors as beta and sensitivities to macroeconomic variables</li>
<li dir="auto">Illiquid stocks need to have higher returns to compensate traders who must face higher transaction costs,
so such logical factors as price per share and volume were included</li>
<li dir="auto">Price level factors essentially capture value strategies, as this category includes share price relative to
various accounting magnitudes</li>
<li dir="auto">Growth potential factors point to the likelihood of higher growth in earnings and dividends, with various
profitability measures being used as proxies in this regard</li>
</ol>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Idea here is that, for a given price relative to accounting measures, indicators suggesting higher future
growth might point to diamonds in the rough</li>

<ol start="5" dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Technical factors include standard momentum and reversal measures</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Reinganum's study (1970-1983) on AMEX and NYSE firms used specific commonalities to screen stocks.

outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 37.14% at a comparable risk.</li>
<li dir="auto">Later,  Haugen  and  Baker  categorised  numerous  predictive  factors  into  five  groups:  risk,  liquidity,  price

successful  in  100  of  the  203  months,  the
