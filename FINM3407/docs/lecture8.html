<p dir="auto">Memory is not a simple matter of information retrieval:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">It is reconstructive
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">In an experimental context, when people witness an event and receive misleading information about it,
this misinformation is often incorporated into their memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">It is variable in intensity…
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">With emotion playing a role</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">It is prone to self  -serving distortion (hindsight bias)
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Since  pleasant  memories  make  you  happier  than  unpleasant  ones,  it  is  not  surprising  that  we  are
sometimes prone to “rewriting history.” It also makes us feel better to think we have more control over
events than we really do, or that we have a good sense of what is likely to happen in the future. The
corollary  to  this  is  that  in  the  past  we  also  must  have  had  a  pretty good  sense  of  what  was  likely to transpire. In other words, “we knew it all along.”</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="heuristics">Heuristics</h3>
<p dir="auto">In many cases, delay is not feasible. Decisions need to be made, even if the environment is one of limited attention, information, and processing capacity, so shortcuts, or heuristics, are necessary.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Heuristics or rules-of-thumb: decision-making shortcuts.</li>
<li dir="auto">Necessary because the world, being a complicated place, must be simplified in order to allow decisions to be made.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="type-1--2-heuristics">Type 1 &amp; 2 Heuristics</h3>
<p dir="auto">Heuristics come in all shapes and sizes.
One dichotomy is between those heuristics that are reflexive, autonomic, and noncognitive, and economise
on effort (Type 1); and others, which are cognitive in nature (Type 2).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Type 1: Autonomic and non-cognitive, conserving on effort.
I choose a hamburger over a hot dog because I usually prefer them
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Used when very quick choice called for</li>
<li dir="auto">Or when it’s “no big deal”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Type 2: Cognitive &amp; requiring effort.
No, I will choose the hot dog today because it is prepared differently and I like to try new things
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Used when you have more time to ponder
Type 2 can overrule Type 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Type 1 is effortless
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">too trivial, was to conserve your effort</li>
<li dir="auto">Choose randomly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Type 2 requiring more effort

<li dir="auto">Make some sort of cost and benefit analysis</li>

<p dir="auto">Food tasting off?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Stop eating it</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">These make good sense and are autonomic.
Other heuristics, which are more cognitive, are related to comfort with the familiar.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="example-diversification-heuristic">Example: Diversification Heuristic</h3>
<p dir="auto">The diversification heuristic suggests that people like to try a little bit of everything when choices are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<hr dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Observe people at a buffet.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Many people are trying a bit of everything</li>
<li dir="auto">Nobody wants to miss out on something good</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">In experiments, people are more willing to bet the colour of a ball drawn at random if they know the bag contains 50 red and 50 blue, than if they know a bag contains blue and red balls in unknown proportions.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="representativeness">Representativeness</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">People judge probabilities “by the degree to which A is representative of B, that is, by the
degree to which A resembles B.”
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A can be a sample and B a population;</li>
<li dir="auto">A can be a person and B a group;</li>
<li dir="auto">A can be an event/effect and B a process/cause</li>

<p dir="auto">Which seems more likely?
A. Jane is a lottery winner.
B. Jane is a happy lottery winner.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many pick B, but A must have a higher probability, as a Venn diagram clearly shows.</p>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Problem: conjunction fallacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">An example of people having difficulty with probabilities is when they have no notion of the difference between simple probabilities (probability of A) and joint probabilities (probability of both A and B).</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, they naturally feel that the probability that they will win the lottery and be overjoyed the next day is higher than the probability that they will just win the lottery.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="base-rate-neglect-and-bayes-rule">Base Rate Neglect and Bayes’ Rule</h3>
<p dir="auto">An important variant of representativeness is base rate neglect.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The tendency to ignore relevant statistical information in favour of case-specific information.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Bayes’ rule, a useful relationship that allows us to evaluate conditional probabilities:</p>
<p dir="auto"><img src="assets\IMG52.PNG" alt="alt text" data-src="assets/IMG52.PNG"></p>
<p dir="auto">It says that the probability of event B, conditional on event A, is equal to the probability of event A, conditional on event B, times the ratio of the simple probabilities (base rates) of event B to event A.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Bayes’ rule allows one to optimally update estimated probability based on the new information (the condition).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><img src="assets\IMG53.PNG" alt="alt text" data-src="assets/IMG53.PNG"></p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="hot-hand-phenomenon">Hot Hand Phenomenon</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Sometimes people feel that distribution/population should look like sample,</li>
<li dir="auto">but sometimes they feel sample should look like distribution/population.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Former is especially true if people aren’t sure about nature of distribution/population.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="gamblers-fallacy">Gambler’s Fallacy</h3>
<p dir="auto">Gambler’s fallacy may apply if people are fairly sure about nature of population.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">They think even small samples should always look like population.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">So, if you flip a coin 9 times getting 6 heads and 3 tails, these people would say that a tail is more likely to come next.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="overestimating-predictability">Overestimating Predictability</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Tendency to underestimate regression to mean – amounts to exaggerating predictability.</li>
<li dir="auto">GPA example: subjects were asked to predict GPA in college from high school GPA of entrants to the college.
