### Q1

- CDS Spread
  - Compensates the protection seller for the default risk of the reference entity
  - Holding a risky bond and the risk-free bond
- Risk premium is always $y-r$
- Market risk premium
- Yield of the risky investment, minus the yield calculated on government bonds
- Breakeven CDS spread should equal the risk premium
- Investors would be indifferent between holding thr risky bond and buying CDS protection or simply holding the risk-free bond

Factors meaning no arbitrage
- counterparty risk
  - CDS seller might not fulfil their obligations, the CDS spread could be higher than the bond yield spread
  - Leads to positive basis
- Bond liquidity
  - Bonds are less liquid that CDS contracts
  - Higher yield to cmpensate lack of liquidity, increases the bond yield spread and drives the basis lower (negative basis)
