# FINM3405 Revision

# lecture 4-8 Options

- 1. Definitions and Concepts
- 2. Moneyness (ITM, ATM, OTM).
- 3. Payoffs vs profits (including the premium).
- 4. Main contracts and markets, contract specifications.
- 5. Pricing bounds and put-call-parity.
- 6. American call premium = European call premium when no dividends.
- 7. Time value and intrinsic value.

- 8. European option premiums/prices via the Black-Scholes model:
  - 8.1. On non-dividend paying assets.
  - 8.2. For dividend/income paying assets.
  - 8.3. For currencies (simply viewed as dividend paying assets).
- 9. Black-Scholes assumption of geometric Brownian motion and consequent log-normal distribution of the underlying asset’s price, or normal distribution of the asset’s returns.
- 10. Simulating geometric Brownian motion in preparation for the Monte Carlo approach to derivative security pricing.
- 11. Heuristic (non-rigorous) discussion of risk-neutral pricing.
- 12. Heuristic (hand-waving) interpretation of the factors affecting option prices, and quantification of this via the Black-Scholes model Greeks.

- 13. Using delta ∆ and gamma Γ to predict small changes in option prices due to small changes in the price of the underlying asset (in preparation for delta and delta-gamma hedging).
- 14. More detailed discussion of theta θ and associated concept of time decay, and how it relates to moneyness.
- 15. Scholes Hedging
  - 15.1 Static delta hedging
  - 15.2 Static delta-gamma hedging
  - 15.3 Dynamic delta hedging.
- 16. Implied volatility 
  - 16.1 volatility smile and term structure
  - 16.2 related VIX index enabling volatility to be directly traded.
- 17. Trading strategies and their payoff and profit/loss diagrams.

- 18. Binomial and Monte Carlo numerical option pricing methods:
  - 18.1 The need for numerical methods:
  - 18.2 Price more complex derivative securities.
  - 18.3 More complex pricing methods than the Black-Scholes model, in particular because returns are not normally distributed.
- 19. 1-period binomial model for European option price and delta.
  - 19.1 Multi-period binomial model for European option price and delta.
- More rigorous introduction of risk-neutral pricing via binomial model.
- Monte Carlo pricing of European options.
  - Simple method that simulates only final asset price.
  - More general method that simulates entire asset price paths in preparation for Monte Carlo pricing of path dependent options.
