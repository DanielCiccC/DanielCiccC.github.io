# Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)


1. Basic concepts relating to risk, including:
  - Types: market, default, liquidity, operational.
  - Portfolio expected return and standard deviation (volatility).
- Concepts related to the normal distribution in preparation for calculating value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES).
- The need for simple, single measures of market risk like VaR and ES.
- VaR and ES definitions, basic concepts, and differences.
- Potential shortcoming of VaR and consequent need for ES.
- Calculating VaR and ES via 2 methods:
  - Parametric approach assuming normally distributed returns.
  - Nonparametric approach directly using historical data.
- Parametric portfolio VaR, worst case VaR, diversification benefits.


# 1. Definitions and Concepts

## 1.1 Risk Types

We could classify risk into the following 4 broad categories:
1. **Market risks**: These are the risks we’ve mostly been discussing this semester, namely risks due to movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, stock prices, commodity prices, etc.
2. **Liquidity risk**: The inability to sell or liquidate assets and financial securities quickly and at prices close to fair market values.
3. **Credit risk**: The risk of loss due to borrowers and counterparties failing to meet, and thus defaulting on, their payment obligations.
4. **Operational risks**: “All others” including human error, fraud and theft, model risk, technology failure, legal risk, weather events, etc.
