### Q1. 
- Exposure of the price of gold going down

You are exposed to spot gold prices falling over teh next few months. To manage this risk, you would short the Aug, Sep, Oct futures contract.

- You produce 1 ton (1,000,000g). Each contract is over m = 1000g
- $\therefore$ you should short $h=1000$ contracts for each month

### Q2. What is the risk of the buyers?
> - Risk of the price going up

Chinese buyers are exposed to the risk of the spot gold prices increasing.
To manage this risk they would go long on the same number of contracts as you would go shorted.

### Q3.
> August, September and October prices are far lower

$$K_{Aug} = 558.76$$
$$K_{Sep} = 558.72$$
$$K_{Oct} = 560.64$$

short payoff= $K âˆ’ S_{T}$

- $m$ = 1000
- $h$ = 1000

August payoff:
$$1000(558.76-575)\cdot 1000 = -16, 240,000$$
Sep Payoff
$$1000(558.72-600)\cdot 1000 = -42, 280,000$$
Sep payoff
$$100 \cdot (560.64 - 625) \cdot 1000 = -64, 360, 000$$$

- These amounts represent how much money you missed out on buy locking in the gold price via futures contract
- The gold price went up which would have benefitted us
