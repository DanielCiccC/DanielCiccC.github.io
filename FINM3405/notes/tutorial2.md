# Tutorial 2

### Q1. 
- Exposure of the price of gold going down

You are exposed to spot gold prices falling over teh next few months. To manage this risk, you would short the Aug, Sep, Oct futures contract.

- You produce 1 ton (1,000,000g). Each contract is over m = 1000g
- $\therefore$ you should short $h=1000$ contracts for each month

### Q2. What is the risk of the buyers?
> - Risk of the price going up

Chinese buyers are exposed to the risk of the spot gold prices increasing.
To manage this risk they would go long on the same number of contracts as you would go shorted.

### Q3.
> August, September and October prices are far lower

$$K_{Aug} = 558.76$$
$$K_{Sep} = 558.72$$
$$K_{Oct} = 560.64$$

short payoff= $K âˆ’ S_{T}$

- $m$ = 1000
- $h$ = 1000

August payoff:
$$1000(558.76-575)\cdot 1000 = -16, 240,000$$
Sep Payoff
$$1000(558.72-600)\cdot 1000 = -42, 280,000$$
Sep payoff
$$100 \cdot (560.64 - 625) \cdot 1000 = -64, 360, 000$$$

- These amounts represent how much money you missed out on buy locking in the gold price via futures contract
- The gold price went up which would have benefitted us
- You're not particularly happy about it, and all you can say to your board is 'what if gold went down?'


### Equities Question 2
> - look at last traded value
> - contract multiplier is 100 (100 shares per contract)


- You own 10,000 tencent shares, and 1 futures contract is over $m=100$ shares
- We would short $h=100$ september contracts

Payoff of combined position (portfolio and futures position)

$$= 10,000\cdot S_{T} + h(K-S_{T})m$$
$$= 10,000 \cdot S_{T} + 10,000(K-S_{T})$$
$$= 10,000S_{T} + 10,000K -10,000S{T}$$
$$=10,000K = 10,000\cdot 357.5 = 3,575,000HKD$$
