### Q1. 
- Exposure of the price of gold going down

You are exposed to spot gold prices falling over teh next few months. To manage this risk, you would short the Aug, Sep, Oct futures contract.

- You produce 1 ton (1,000,000g). Each contract is over m = 1000g
- $\therefore$ you should short $h=1000$ contracts for each month
