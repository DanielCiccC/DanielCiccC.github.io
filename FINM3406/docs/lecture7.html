<p dir="auto">Prepare an analytical report for a real-life Health Care Development Project.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The Report is to be prepared on behalf of a hypothetical listed A-REIT that specialises in Health care properties and is seeking professional advice on the risks, issues and opportunities associated with acquiring, developing and holding a proposed Health Care development project.</li>
<li dir="auto">The students will act as professional advisors to the hypothetical A-REIT and prepare a 5,000 word (excluding bibliography) report that outlines their assessment of the project and its efficacy for their client as a project to add to its REIT portfolio of health care properties.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Aged Care is a little bit different</li>
<li dir="auto">complicated financial modelling</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Current project has a little bit of complexity and is fairly consistent with other markets</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The details of the report must include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">An analytical description of the property and its proposed development attributes including observations on the concept, target market, design/layout, and overall viability of the project.</li>
<li dir="auto">A discussion on the health care property sector in Queensland and comparative assessment of the REIT market for health care properties domestically and globally.</li>
<li dir="auto">A risk assessment of the project identifying the primary strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities for the project.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">How do you talk about viability</li>
<li dir="auto">size scale, location, demographics of the area
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">look at macro and micro perspective in regards the site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">look at the property sector
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Is this the best possible use of your money?</li>
<li dir="auto">Is it right size, space, location, timing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Target markets, design layout</li>
<li dir="auto">SWOT analysis
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Opportunities and strengths are inherent</li>
<li dir="auto">Weaknesses threats are external factors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">An overview of the funding mechanisms available to the REIT for the development.</li>
<li dir="auto">High-level financial modelling of the project that includes financial performance metrics and an assessment of the target purchase price for the project. (ie static residual value hypothetical development model and DCF with performance metrics - IRR, NPV, ROE, Cash on Cash)</li>
<li dir="auto">Details of any assumptions required to be made and the basis for those
assumptions.</li>
<li dir="auto">Bibliography and referencing to Harvard standard.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Ratio of debt to equity
Normally in development, with debt is enough to cover the hard costs (construction, land)
not usual to see 50-55% of total debt to cost</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Financial modelling</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Not a valuation, but must define value</li>
<li dir="auto">If doing this as a valuation, numbers are much more complicated and rigorous
Market cap - cap rate from market evidence</li>
<li dir="auto">find industry commentary - will be adequate enough</li>
<li dir="auto">looking at sales evidence (don't need RP data) just research an justify
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">realcommercial.com e.g. have to reference it. Less research in terms of deriving the number</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Need to do a DCF</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">cost of acquiring</li>
<li dir="auto">development site, hypothetical/residual model
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">what it is worth when it is finished being built</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">aggregate them into a single number</li>
<li dir="auto">land value from sales evidence - might be able to use this</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Performance metrics</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">IRR, NPV</li>
<li dir="auto">Is this comparable to industry</li>
<li dir="auto">weaknesses and threats are so big, don't do it e.g.</li>
<li dir="auto">If you have to make an assumption ask tutor (that you aren't making too much of a shortcut)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Note – the ECP in relation to the group assignment is wrong, it states:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">“a real-life real estate Rent development project” - that is not the case this
year, it is a health care project.</li>
<li dir="auto">“The Report is to be prepared on behalf of a hypothetical
potential investor” - that is not the case, the report is for a hypothetical
listed A-REIT and for the sake of the exercise let’s call it the Live Well
Healthcare REIT (ASX:LWH).</li>
<li dir="auto">Additionally, this year’s report calls for a discussion of the health care
property sector and a discussion on the performance of REITs in general
and health care REITs specifically.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">It is for a Hypothetical listed AREIT</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">not just talk about the healthcare market</li>
<li dir="auto">investigate REIT sector on healthcare specifically</li>
