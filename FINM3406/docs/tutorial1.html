<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and</li>
<li dir="auto">Are subject to the same laws and regulations</li>
<li dir="auto">Instruments that often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">when it comes to marking - maybe 0.5 points per point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="types-of-asset-classes">types of asset classes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Bonds (fixed interest) – defensive	asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Cash - defensive asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Commodities (Gold, silver etc) - defensive asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Futures – defensive asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Financial derivatives – defensive asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Property – growth asset (although also a wasting asset)</li>
<li dir="auto">Equities (stocks and shares) – growth asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Crypto currencies (very speculative but still possibly an asset class)</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="introduction-to-property---similarities-and-differences-to-other-asset-classes">Introduction to property - similarities and differences to other asset classes</h3>
<p dir="auto">Defensive assets</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Easily convert into cash - more liquid</li>
<li dir="auto">Less risky</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Growth assets</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Long term commitment, grows over longer time horizon</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="difference-between-a-defensive-and-a-growth-asset">Difference between a defensive and a growth asset</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto"><strong>&quot;Growth assets&quot;</strong> – usually used to describe assets which were primarily invested in to provide potential capital growth, and</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>&quot;Defensive assets&quot;</strong> – usually used to describe assets which broadly held their capital value and were invested in for access to reliable income streams.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="list-seven-ways-that-real-estate-is-similar-to-other-asset-classes">List seven ways that real estate is similar to other asset classes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Potential for appreciation: Like other asset classes, real estate has the potential to appreciate in value over time.</li>
<li dir="auto">Income generation: Real estate, like stocks and bonds, can generate income through rental or lease payments.</li>
<li dir="auto">Liquidity: Real estate, like other asset classes, can be bought and sold, though it may not be as liquid as some other investments.</li>
<li dir="auto">Risk and volatility: Real estate, like other asset classes, can be subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which can affect its value.</li>
<li dir="auto">Diversification: Real estate can be used as a means of diversifying an investment portfolio, similar to how stocks and bonds can be used for diversification.</li>
<li dir="auto">Use of leverage: Investors can use leverage to purchase real estate, similar to how margin can be used to purchase stocks.</li>
<li dir="auto">Demand and supply: Real estate, like other asset classes, is influenced by demand and supply dynamics, which can affect its price and value over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="why-are-decisions-about-property-generally-more-complex-and-time-consuming-compared-to-decisions-about-other-asset-classes">Why are decisions about property generally more complex and time consuming compared to decisions about other asset classes?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Size – large capital requirements (big barrier to entry)</li>
<li dir="auto">Regulatory environment – high degree of regulatory control and compliance (lots of direct obligations arising from ownership)</li>
<li dir="auto">Uniqueness (no two properties are exactly the same)
Time line – long time from inception to use/monetisation</li>
<li dir="auto">Property is a wasting asset – depreciation and obsolescence (built form)</li>
<li dir="auto">Limited liquidity (slow to sell)</li>
<li dir="auto">Quality of management impacts value (active management required as it is a wasting asset. Bad management destroys value, good management creates and retains value)</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="list-seven-ways-real-estate-is-different-to-other-asset-classes">List seven ways real estate is different to other asset classes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Tangibility: physical assets</li>
<li dir="auto">High transaction costs: typically involve higher transaction costs than other asset classes</li>
<li dir="auto">Illiquidity: real estate investments are typically less liquid than other asset classes, meaning it may take longer to buy or sell a property compared to stocks or bonds</li>
<li dir="auto">Localised markets: real estate markets are often localised</li>
<li dir="auto">Management intensive, require active management, such as property management, tenant management, and regulatory compliance.</li>
<li dir="auto">High capital requirements.: Investing in real estate typically requires a significant amount of capital, which may not be the case for other asset classes</li>
<li dir="auto">Sensitivity to interest rate: can be sensitive to changes in interest rates which may not be the case for other asset classes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Other factors:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Intangible factors related to real estate- property rights, legal fees, legalities related to the property</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Other decisions</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Size: large capital requirement (Big barrier to entry)</li>
<li dir="auto">Regulatory environment - high degree of regulatory control</li>
<li dir="auto">Uniqueness</li>
<li dir="auto">Timeline</li>
<li dir="auto">Property is a wasting asset</li>
<li dir="auto">Limited liquidity</li>
<li dir="auto">Quality of management impacts value. (Active management required as it is a wasting asset. Bad management destroys value, good management creates and retains value)</li>
