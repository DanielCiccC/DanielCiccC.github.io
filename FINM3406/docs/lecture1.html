<h3 id="what-is-real-estate">What is Real Estate?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tangible Asset (physical)</li>
<li>When viewed as a tangible real estate includes:
<ul>
<li>Land (Cuius est solum, eius est uesque ad coelum et ad inferos)
<ul>
<li>Has to be real estate? Where does it start and stop?</li>
<li>Rivers? Beaches?</li>
<li>Historically a legal maximum and minimum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements on the land (appurtenances)
<ul>
<li>merged with the land as a single asset</li>
<li>Title to the land includes all the assets on the land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does not include removable items (plant &amp; equipment)
<ul>
<li>If it's fixed, then considered part of the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can it be Intangible (nonphysical)?
<ul>
<li>Contractual rights (ie leases, mortgages, options etc) - NO
<ul>
<li>Lease forms creates property rights and contractual rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easements &amp; Profit-a-prendre - YES
<ul>
<li>Property right - access easement (e.g.).</li>
<li>Profit-a-prendre - right to take from the property (harvest, e.g.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Property Rights vs Contractual Rights
<ul>
<li>Privity of Contract vs Rights against the world
<ul>
<li>I can only enforce my rights against the person I have a contract with</li>
<li>Rights against the world - trespassing on your occupied property</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bundle of Rights Theory
<ul>
<li>Ownership (private right enforceable against strangers)</li>
<li>Possession (possession is 9/10 of the law)</li>
<li>Control (what is built and what takes place)</li>
<li>Enjoyment (can use as see fit)</li>
<li>Exclusion (no trespassing)</li>
<li>Disposal (sale, lease or by will) &amp; Destruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These rights are not unconstrained
<ul>
<li>Government controls (ie Planning, Environment, Heritage and Property Laws, Compulsory acquisition)
<ul>
<li>If the government decides it wants to build infrastructure on your land they can do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Common law (ie nuisance)
<ul>
<li>Can't light a fire on your land and create smoke the goes into neighbours</li>
<li>Cannot dam shared river/water over properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self imposed (Contracts – restrictive covenants, leases, mortgages, liens, caveats)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conceptual-frameworks-for-ownership">Conceptual Frameworks for Ownership</h3>

<li>Every individual has a right to privately own property</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liberal democratic society grundnorm (freedom and liberty)

<li>Property rights - communitarial obligation (heritage buildings, environmental protection etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socialist perspective
<ul>
<li>State controls ownership and use of real estate</li>

<li>Private ownership limited – no right to buy or sell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communist perspective

<li>State owns all real estate. Private property is abolished
<ul>
<li>Determination of how it is used an allocated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State determines how real estate is used and allocated, with the goal of equal distribution of resources and wealth</li>
<li>Hybrid models exist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="purpose-of-built-form--why-do-we-need-property">Purpose of built form – Why do we need property?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enclosure/delimitation of space</li>

<ul>
<li>barrier or modifier of climate</li>
<li>Manufactuiring medicine, need modified climate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protection and privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Buildings create environmental conditions indoors which are more stable
and predictable than those outdoors. In so doing they enable activities to
take place that otherwise would not.</p>
<p>A building like a company, should help us to do more things and to make
things more abundantly better</p>

<h3 id="why-are-decisions-about-property-generally-more-complex-and-time-consuming-compared-to-decisions-about-other-asset-classes">Why are decisions about property generally more complex and time consuming compared to decisions about other asset classes?</h3>
<p>(Question has always been formed in the final exam) - would need to compare and contrast other asset classes</p>
<ul>
<li>Size – large capital requirements
<ul>
<li>If you are buying or selling a piece of real estate, they tend to cost more than buying an ounce of gold e.g.</li>
<li>Larger capital requirements than most asset classes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regulatory environment – high degree of regulatory control and compliance
<ul>
<li>massive degree of regulatory control</li>
<li>Health and Safety</li>
<li>Toxic materials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uniqueness</li>
<li>Time line – long time from inception to use/monetisation
<ul>
<li>contracts, signing etc. Potentially no return for a very long time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Property is a wasting asset – depreciation and obsolescence
<ul>
<li>Built form depreciates and becomes obsolete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limited liquidity</li>
<li>Quality of management impacts value
<ul>
<li>Improve the value by being smart, with renovations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Equity in real estate - the equity component is the amount you own in the property, excluding the debt component</p>
