<h3 id="real-estate-valuation">Real Estate Valuation</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a valuation?
<ul>
<li>Real estate valuation is the formal process of determining the value or worth of real property, which as discussed
previously could include land, buildings, and other improvements.</li>
<li>The aim of a real estate valuation is for an expert to establish an accurate and reliable assessment of the “value” of the bundle of rights that a person has in a particular property.</li>
<li>The assessment can be expressed as a range of values but generally a single amount is adopted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>formal, not ad-hoc process</p>
<ul>
<li>Can take valuation to the bank, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>real property, land, building, attachments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are valuations important?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buying or selling a property</strong>: The value of a property is a crucial factor in determining the purchase price or selling price.</li>
<li><strong>Financing</strong>: Lenders require an accurate valuation of a property before approving a mortgage or other loan secured by real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Property tax assessment</strong>: Real estate valuation is used to determine the land tax and rates assessment, which is based on the assessed value of the property.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: The value of a property is a key factor in determining the amount of insurance coverage needed.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Reporting</strong>: Valuations are used in both private and public sectors for their financial reports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>process of getting data is slow</li>
<li>Lenders want security
<ul>
<li>have ratios with respect to value: LMI</li>
<li>LMI: you default on your loan and there is a shortfall purchasing back the property, insurance company will pay the difference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Valuation used for divorce settlements, statutory purpose (resumed by the government)</li>
<li>Insurance for building; value the building for insurance
<ul>
<li>If you over or under-insure your property, you are penalised</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="role-of-the-property-valuer">Role of the property Valuer</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Australia experts who undertake valuations are referred to as Property Valuers
<ul>
<li>Certified Practicing Valuers accredited through the Australian Property Institute; and/or</li>
<li>Registered Valuers - see Valuers Registration Act (Qld)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In North America they are referred to as an “Appraisers”</li>
<li>In the UK they are referred to as a “Chartered Surveyors”</li>
<li>Profession has evolved over the years
<ul>
<li>40 years ago just a diploma and practical experience</li>
<li>Now degree qualifications and minimum two years experience required</li>
<li>Specialisation of valuers (ie rural, mining, specialist retail, plant and machinery)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>In QLD, cannot provide a valuation report unless you are a registered valuer</li>
<li>Have specialisations - residential commercial, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-property-valuer">The property Valuer</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Property Valuer will receive instructions to undertake a particular type of valuation of a property.</li>
<li>The Property Valuer will determine the “value” (whichever type of value is instructed) of the property as at the date they were asked to assess it.</li>
<li>The date of valuation can be as at the date when the valuer was instructed or some date in the past BUT Property Valuers do not give predictions about the value of a property sometime in the future.</li>
<li>The “value” is the Property Valuer’s opinion about the property's worth in accordance with the instructions given.</li>
<li>It is an opinion given by a suitably qualified expert about something that possibly hasn’t happened and may never happen (ie a market value assessment of a property that hasn’t sold and may never sell).</li>
<li>Property Valuers are engaged not only because the client wants a reliable assessment of value for their personal reasons but also because they want to have recourse to the Property Valuer’s Professional Indemnity insurance should something go wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>historic valuation, valuation at a particular point in the past for tax purposes, e.g.</li>
<li>CANNOT future-date a property valuation (and put their name on it, etc.)</li>
<li>Just an opinion - rarely will you see a valuer value a property more than what is it worth (when getting valued after a sale)</li>
<li>Professional indemnity insurance - sue if the valuation was wrong
<ul>
<li>Banks will be happy to take an AI generated value of the property</li>
<li>Potential for days to be numbered; simple valuations could be automated - residential for example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certificate of valuation
<ul>
<li>generic limitations added to the valuation; no contamination e.g. (not going to do tests for contamination)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="valuation-report">Valuation report</h3>
<ul>
<li>Property Valuer’s produce valuation reports that advise the “value” of the property and generally include:
<ul>
<li>Certificate of Valuation (stating the value of the property as at the date of valuation and signed by the valuer)</li>
<li>Outline of the primary method of valuation (including financial modelling) and check method adopted</li>
<li>Detailed description of any sales evidence relied upon</li>
<li>Outline of any assumptions, limitations (ie land not contaminated, no encroachments etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The most comprehensive part of the valuation report tends to be about the subject property.
<ul>
<li>Detailed description of the property being valued including:
<ul>
<li>property’s title</li>
<li>zoning</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>land size</li>
<li>building size and condition</li>
<li>site amenity and services</li>
<li>encumbrances (ie easements, registered leases)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>all information on the valuation should be outlined</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="different-types-of-valuations">Different types of valuations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land Value comprises</strong>:
<ul>
<li>‘Private Benefit’ infrastructure, that services individual properties paid for through local government levied user charges (eg local roads, reticulated water and sewerage, storm water drainage, local parks);</li>
<li>‘Social’ infrastructure paid for by government through tax and excise income (eg schools and hospitals, public transport, arterial road networks); and</li>
<li>Urban externalities (eg amenity and aspect)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Land value is impacted by external factors
<ul>
<li>Betterment is “the capitalised value of urban externalities (amenity, access to services, etc.) and (unpriced) social infrastructure”.</li>
<li>Blight can also impact property and is created by infrastructure development and planning policy decisions. It occurs where these activities diminish land value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>more land the more the property is worth
<ul>
<li>reasons why the size of land is not the determining factor of its value</li>
<li>local land has a lot more infrastructure associated with it</li>
<li>the more infrastructure that benefits the land will directly effect the property value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Betterment - capitalised value of externalities, social infrastructure</li>
<li>Blight - big roads, sewerage where activities diminish land value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-value">What do we mean by value?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value of real estate like most assets and commodities is ultimately governed by the law of supply and demand</p>
<ul>
<li>When demand is high and supply is low prices tend to increase.</li>
<li>Conversely when supply is high and demand is low prices tend to decrease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real estate is regarded as an “inelastic asset”</p>
<ul>
<li>Real estate is a scarce/limited resource</li>
<li>There is a long lead time to build new or bring existing properties to market in response to demand</li>
<li>Changes in price of real estate do not always have a direct impact on quantity supplied or demanded</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real estate market is considered an “imperfect market”</p>
<ul>
<li>Information asymmetry: Buyers and sellers may not have access to equal understanding of the market or the asset being sold
<ul>
<li>more often than not, vendor knows more about the asset than the seller</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High transaction costs: barrier to entry for many potential buyers</li>
<li>Limited competition: Zoning restrictions and availability of infrastructure limit provision of new stock to compete with existing stock</li>
<li>Emotional factors: People buy real estate for personal sentimental reasons not always rationally</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price paid for a piece of real estate may not accurately reflect its true value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. someone who grew up in a particular area and will pay a premium to continue to live there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-than-one-type-of-value">More than one type of value</h3>
<ul>
<li>International Valuation Standards effective 31 January 2022 defines different types of value:</li>
<li>Fair Market Value
<ul>
<li>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines “fair market value” as the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in a transaction on the open market.</li>
<li>For United States tax purposes, Regulation §20.2031-1 states: “The'fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Liquidation Value
<ul>
<li>The amount that would be realised when an asset or group of assets are sold on a piecemeal basis. Liquidation value should take into account the costs of getting the assets into saleable condition as well as those of the disposal activity. Liquidation value can be determined under two different premises of value:
<ul>
<li>(a) an orderly transaction with a typical marketing period; or</li>
<li>(b) a forced transaction with a shortened marketing period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>International Valuation Standards effective 31 January 2022 defines different types of value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market Value
<ul>
<li>The estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Existing Use Value
<ul>
<li>Current use/existing use is the current way an asset, liability, or group of assets and/or liabilities is used. The current use may be, but is not necessarily, also the highest and best use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>fair market value: how much would a willing buyer and willing seller
<ul>
<li>both have sufficient time and money to complete the transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Existing use value; current use is its highest and best use</li>

<h3 id="valuation-methodologies">Valuation methodologies</h3>
<p><strong>Steps to conduct a valuation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 - Define the Problem
<ul>
<li>Define the property rights to be valued</li>
<li>Define the type of valuation being instructed</li>
<li>Define the date of valuation</li>
<li>Identify the data need to conduct the valuation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 2 - Determine the most probable use
<ul>
<li>Is the current use the property’s “Highest &amp; Best Use”?</li>
<li>“Highest and Best Use” is the use of an asset that maximises its potential and that is possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 3 - Define the most probable buyer
<ul>
<li>Who is likely to buy the property</li>
<li>How is that sector of the market behaving (ie what are the buyers
doing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 4 - Select the Valuation Methodology
<ul>
<li>What are the instructions form the client</li>
<li>Is the property likely to be valued on market activity, cost or income considerations (How do buyers and sellers act in this sector of the market)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 5 – Review and Adjust for External Factors
<ul>
<li>Accurate property data (title, survey, permits, leases and rent
review dates - normally easy to get)</li>
<li>Accurate market data (sales evidence readily available   - leasing
evidence not so much)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Step 6 - Value Conclusion and Limiting Conditions
<ul>
<li>Final estimate/opinion of value determined</li>
<li>Report completed</li>
<li>Assumptions and limitations defined</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Discounted Cash Flow (more detail in week 6)</li>
<li>Units of Production</li>
<li>Capitalisation method</li>
</ul>
<p>METHODS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one method is considered inherently superior
(depends upon property type), however each have their
advantages in a particular application.</li>
<li>Methods are used as primary and check methods.</li>
<li>Directly comparable recent sale evidence is hard to beat</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct comparison normally the best method</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="direct-comparison">Direct Comparison</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplest method</li>
<li>Used when sales evidence is comparable enough to subject to allow direct comparison.</li>
<li>Most popular method of valuation incorporated in the valuation of non income producing properties.</li>
<li>Like with Like, Apples with Apples</li>
<li>Perfect World Scenario – Real challenge is adjustments for items that are not comparable (no two properties the same)</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>social and property infrastructure</li>
<li>need to make adjustments
<ul>
<li>size, shape, configuration, time between sales</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make massive adjustments to bring to subject property, this ceases to be a valid valuation method</li>
<li>directly comparable sale you choose to ignore - doesn't satisfy the 'test' of sale
<ul>
<li>e.g. adjoining sale (pay a premium to the sale)</li>
<li>someone defaulting on their mortgage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summation-method">Summation method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collation of value through the addition of constituent parts or components of a property.</li>
<li>Used predominantly as a check method. Example:</li>
</ul>

</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>Land component treated as if it was vacant</li>
<li>Building and improvements is their added value to the land (can be challenging to assess accurately – depreciated replacement cost)</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>try and get the building almost for free if you can
<ul>
<li>disconnect between the value of the land and improved form</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-and-after">Before and After</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used to assess compensation as result of compulsory acquisition, easement or encumbrance</li>
<li>Simply the difference in value before and after the imposition of the event</li>
<li>Method requires two separate valuations</li>
<li>One before and one after</li>
<li>Can also be used in aggregating and/or subdividing properties</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>used in acquisition</li>
<li>what is the property worth with/without changes made in your land</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="hypothetical-development">Hypothetical Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used to assess land under-developed but has:
<ul>
<li>Highest and Best Use as a development site</li>
<li>Immediate potential for development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suited to assess englobo (in-globo) land</li>
<li>Method starts at the end and works backwards</li>
<li>Hypothetical Development Equation:
<ul>
<li>Value of Finished Product = land value + dev costs + finance costs + profit</li>
<li>Value of Land = Value of Finished Product – (dev costs + finance costs + profit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suitable only for static residual value calculations (single phase developments)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>work out whether you are getting a yield worth justifying purchasing property</li>
<li>Also called static residual valuation method
<ul>
<li>do in one stage, does not include TVOM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only works if you do everything in one stage</li>
<li>know what it is going to be worth in the end</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="discounted-cash-flows">Discounted cash flows</h3>
<ul>
<li>Method involves assessing the present value of future cash flow</li>
<li>Method based on subjective assumption</li>
<li>Allows cash flow flexibility</li>
<li>Useful in the assessment of complex and variable income properties</li>
<li>Can be dangerous in the wrong hands – lots of assumptions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>good ability to manipulate assumptions
<ul>
<li>discounting rate, escalation rate, TVOM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have to define an investment horizon</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="units-of-production">Units of Production</h3>
<ul>
<li>Common application for Rural properties</li>
<li>Carrying capacity, Beast area value</li>
<li>Applied to specialised commercial properties
<ul>
<li>hotel liquor consumption</li>
<li>bed rate in boarding houses</li>
<li>Room rate in hotel / motel</li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common in rural valuations
<ul>
<li>care about how many cows you can have oon your farm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>valuation based upon production capability
<ul>
<li>aged care facilities, beds are licenced by the government</li>
<li>child care centres based upon number of licences in the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="capitalisation-method">Capitalisation method</h2>
<ul>
<li>This valuation method is used for investment class properties</li>
<li>This method has been widely accepted as being suitable for the estimation of Market Value.</li>
<li>Under this method, the Future Sustainable Annual Net Income of the subject property is converted to a capital sum (or value) by a market derived multiplier.</li>
<li>There is a basic assumption that the level of income will remain constant in perpetuity, or at least sufficiently long term to adopt a calculation of the income stream in perpetuity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="capitalisation-rate">Capitalisation Rate</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cap rate often referred to as yield or “All Risks Rate”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a rate that represents all current and future expectations and benefits to be derived from a property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rate can be used as a benchmark for the comparison of investments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits - very simple to use and easy to compare with other assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges – integrity and availability of market data to derive rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formula used for the Capitalisation Method is:</p>

<li>
<p>The valuer needs to establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Open Market Rental Rate applicable to the property by reference to market rental evidence.</li>
<li>The Cap Rate by analysis of recent sales evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The factor is generally applied to the analysis/valuation of income streams (annuities) from real
property held freehold in fee simple which are considered to be enjoyed in perpetuity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the capitalisation rate rises, investment value falls. For example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note the Cap Rate is a market derived discount rate BUT is different from discount rate applied in a Discount Cash Flow.</p>

<h3 id="capitalisation-rate--years-purchase">Capitalisation Rate – Years Purchase</h3>
<ul>
<li>An alternate way of explaining the relationship between net income and
property value is the number of years needed to buy the property.</li>
<li>Years Purchase is the reciprocal of the capitalisation rate:</li>

<h3 id="outgoings">Outgoings</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Outgoings are the expenses incurred in operating an income producing property. They are limited to non-capital items.Typically, they would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repairs and Maintenance</li>
<li>Rates, Land Taxes, Fire Brigade Levy</li>
<li>Water &amp; Sewerage, Gas, Oil and Power charges</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Gardening &amp; Landscaping</li>
<li>Cleaning, Waste Removal &amp; Pest Control</li>
<li>Insurances</li>
<li>Air Conditioning, Ventilation, Lifts</li>
<li>Management and Administrative costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some property costs are the responsibility of the owner (eg.,capital costs, land tax, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other costs may be recovered from the Lessee, depending on what has been agreed in the lease document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, any recoverable outgoings are charged to the Lessee monthly with the rent payment.  These costs are  based on a budget established at the beginning of each year, with audit adjustments at year’s end. The Lessee is then charged or credited with the annual difference (actual versus estimate).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property-income">Property Income</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Rent:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The annual rent, usually paid on a monthly in advance basis, as set out in the Schedule to the lease. The gross rent is <em>inclusive of outgoings</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Net Rent:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The gross rent payable less outgoings incurred.  The lessee is required to pay an additional sum for outgoings as specified in the lease document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An accountancy firm has leased one 1,000m2  floor of a 5,000m2 office building, plus 10 parking bays, for period of five years at a commencing rental rate of $250 per m2 per annum for the office space and $300 per calendar month per bay.</li>
<li>The lease indicates that the Lessee is required to pay 20% of the building outgoings as specified in a schedule to the lease document. Total budgeted recoverable outgoings for the building is $500,000, or $100 per m2  per annum.</li>
<li>This is a net lease.</li>
<li>If it were a gross lease, the rental would have been stated in the lease as $350 per m2 and there would be no mention of outgoings being paid.</li>

<h3 id="establishing-the-annual-net-sustainable-income">Establishing the Annual Net Sustainable Income</h3>
<ul>
<li>The valuer must critically examine and review the lease documents for the subject property to establish the passing rental rates.</li>
<li>The valuer must then compare those rental rates to the market rent that would be applicable to the property if being let at the time of valuation.</li>
<li>It is the market rental that is considered to be the potential or Future Sustainable Income for the property and it is this rental that is used to calculate the NI.</li>
<li>The valuer will also capture any other income that the property is capable of producing, ie., car parking, naming rights, signage, etc.</li>

<h3 id="establishing-the-capitalisation-rate-or-yield">Establishing the Capitalisation Rate (or Yield)</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the simplest level, the Cap Rate can be determined by the valuer through an analysis of recently sold comparable properties.</li>
<li>If two of the three factors of the basic capitalisation formula are known, then the third can be derived.</li>
<li>Therefore, if the sale amount (the capital value) and the Net Operating Income can be established for the comparable properties, the third factor, the Cap Rate, can be calculated:</li>

<h3 id="shortcomings-of-the-capitalisation-method">Shortcomings of the Capitalisation Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Errors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This has been an application of the Capitalisation Method at its most basic level. In the real world, there is obviously a lot more data collection, analysis and adjustment to the numbers that needs to be effected.</li>
<li>In short, this method is simple to apply but is highly sensitive to data errors. Not only is there the difficulty of locating recently sold comparable properties, but there is the added problem of assessing their net annual income and an applicable cap rate, as much of this information is confidential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliability of Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The valuer must invest considerable time and effort in reviewing the financial facts applicable to the subject property.  The most reliable information sources will be from other assignments undertaken by valuer and colleagues, and this may be limited in scope.</li>
<li>The valuer must therefore network with others in the industries and hope for a sharing of information. Even then, the available data may come from buildings with differences in age, condition, location, materials, quality of services and finishes, lease structures and management quality, to name a few.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Assumption of Sustainable Net Income:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The conventional practice is to estimate what a stabilised net annual income for the subject property will be. This assumes that this income level will “settle down” in perpetuity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection of the Cap Rate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A minor error in establishing the Cap Rate will have a major impact on the estimated property value.</li>
<li>The Cap Rate is often referred to as an “All Risk Yield” because it incorporates allowances for every source of risk to which the investment is perceived to be exposed.</li>
<li>The component risks would include the “risk free rate”, inflation, anticipated interest rate movements, rental rate movements, vacancies, building expense variations, obsolescence, terminal value risk, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite its shortcomings, the Capitalisation method is widely used in the property industry, either as a primary or secondary valuation methodology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not universally popular however, as one unkind commentator observed:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Capitalisation approach to valuation is a method that uses two unknowns (Sustainable Net Income and the Cap Rate) to calculate a third unknown (Property Value)!?”</p>
