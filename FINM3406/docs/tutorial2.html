<li dir="auto">and retains for the grantor or the grantor’s heirs the right to take back, at some time in the future, the full estate that the grantor enjoyed before the conveyance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">A remainder is the future estate (ie like a reversion)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">but rather than returning to the grantor the future estate will go to a third person and not back to the original grantor.</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="10-describe-the-doctrine-of-tenure-and-explain-why-it-still-applies-today-in-australia">10.  Describe the Doctrine of Tenure and explain why it still applies today in Australia?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The Doctrine of Tenure is a legal principle that originated in medieval England and is still applied in Australia today.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">It refers to the concept of land ownership and tenure, meaning that individuals or groups who own land- hold it by way of a grant from the Crown</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">(the “Crown” is now referred to as the “State”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">All other landowners hold their land as a form of tenure, meaning they have certain rights and obligations attached to their ownership.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">For example, they may owe taxes or
military service to the monarch in exchange for their landholding.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto"></li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="11-what-are-the-three-sources-for-rights-and-obligations-under-a-lease">11.  What are the three sources for rights and obligations under a lease?</h3>
<p dir="auto">- Written contract (primary source of rights and obligations between the parties).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Part VIII of the Property Law Act 1974 (QLD):
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">s 105 – tenant’s obligation to pay rent, keep in repair etc.</li>
<li dir="auto">s 107 – landlord’s right to enter, repair etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Common law – implied terms and conditions:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Tenant right – quiet enjoyment</li>
<li dir="auto">Landlord obligation - non derogation of grant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="12-what-are-the-main-differences-between-a-lease-and-a-license">12. What are the main differences between a lease and a license?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">lease creates both property and contractual rights for the lessee</li>
<li dir="auto">a license only creates contractual rights for the licensee</li>
<li dir="auto">The lessee’s rights in relation to their use of the property can be enforced against the world at large.</li>
<li dir="auto">A licencee can only enforce rights in relation to their use of the property can be enforced against the licensor.</li>
<li dir="auto">A lease can be assigned by the lessee to a third party (subject to express provision in the lease prohibiting/restricting this).</li>
<li dir="auto">A licence cannot be assigned (unless it is associated with a lease – eg carparking licence as part of a retail lease).</li>
<li dir="auto">A lease grants exclusive possession of a premises (a licence is non-exclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">WHY THIS MATTERS –</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">it impacts your security of tenure if you need to occupy a property (ie leases is better than licences) and makes your income stream as an investment less secure.</li>
</ul>
