# Lecture 8 - Debt and taxes

## DEBT & EQUITY CAPITAL
**Four Categories**

- Capital Markets can be divided into four categories based on 
whether they are public or private markets and if the assets are 
traded with debt or equity.
- **Public Markets** -  small units (“shares”) of ownership in assets 
are traded in public exchanges. i.e. stock market
- Public markets have a high degree of liquidity – generally possible 
to quickly sell units of the assets at or near the last quoted price.
- Public markets have high informational efficiency 

> Risks, time costs, availability
> - Public equity or private equity?
>
> Public markets
> - Generally a high degree of liquidity in public markets
> - High informational efficiency - equally to buyers and sellers

**Private Markets**
- assets are traded privately between individual 
buyers and sellers
- Generally less liquid than public markets
- Common for whole assets (entire company, property etc.) to be purchased
- Private markets are less informationally efficient than Public markets

**Debt assets**
- Debt Assets – rights to future cash flows to be paid out by borrowers on loans
- E.g. interest payments and retirement of principal on a loan
- Debt assets may provide owners with a relatively senior claim to obtaining cash than the underlying asset 
- Debt cash flows provide relative security over how much and when payments will be made

> Private markets
> - difficult to sectionally sell components of an asset
> - Generally buy the whole company
>
> Debt asset
> - bank that has lent money to somebody, asset to the bank
> - Bank and someone has put money into the account, it is a liability for the bank
> - Can either be unsecured or secured
>   - Person who owns the debt asset may receive/access an asset if the debt obligations are not met

**Equity Assets**
- give owners the “residual” claim in the cash flows  generated 
by underlying asset
- Lacks seniority to debt owed on the asset/property
- Tends to be more risky than debt
- Equity owners tend to have more control over managing underlying assets & are 
better able to benefit from growth
- Owners need to sell the asset in order to liquidate their holding – means more 
volatile market


 . | **Public Markets** | **Private Markets**
 | --- | --- | ---
 Debt assets | Bonds, MBS (mortgage backed securities), Money instruments | Bank loans, Whole mortgages, Venture debt and LBOs
 Equity Assets | Stocks, REITS, Mutual Funds | Real Property, Private Equity, Hedge Funds

## DEBT & EQUITY FINANCING FOR REAL ESTATE

### Overview of Debt – Senior Debt

![alt text](assets\IMG31.PNG)

- Bank Debt
    - Most liquid and flexible option, albeit bank focused on investment grade
    - Can be structured as bilateral, clubs or syndicates

> - The loan you get from the bank
> - large loans you are probably not getting from one bank
>   - banks will syndicate to create the loan
>
> Other types of senior debt
> - Bonds - securitised by the government
>   - company, the company pays back the debt obligations
>   - Japanese bonds issued with negative interest rates

- Alternative Capital
    - Wholesale notes: New product funded mostly by high net worth individuals 
    - Private placements: Funds are emerging as a new class of lender, albeit at higher cost than banks

> Convertible note:
>  - if you default, convert debt into equity

### Gearing
**Development Property**
- Bank funding capped 70-80% of the development cost
- Pre-sales required to cover 100% of the bank debt

Commercial Property
- LVR up to 60-65% for senior and 70-80% sub/mezzanine debt
- REITS aim for gearing of <40% to maintain investment grade rating
  
> Banks will not lend you the full amount
> - E.g. \$20M to build, you will only be able to borrow 15-16M
>   - sell for $300k
>   - want to see you ahve sold 60% of the units, contracts must be enforceable and locked in to cover the costs of the debt
>
> If you only have only 20% equity, need other forms of debt

### Capital Structure – Junior / Mezzanine Debt

- Globally, a growing market with a commercial prevalence of credit funds emerging with 30 – 40 of them now operating in Australia
- More expensive than senior debt due to lower guarantor / security ranking
- Primarily used to increase debt levels above senior debt capacity
- Lenders to this class of debt include:
  - Super funds
  - High-yield funds
  - Uni-tranche funds
  - Special situation funds
  - Distressed funds

> Mezzanine debt is a layer of debt that sits above the debt but beneath equity
> - bridges the gap between equity and debt
> - generally have to pay a lot more for it
> - used for where something in the development project could be sold quickly and is ready within a short period of time

### Capital Structure – Equity

- Space Market Investment
- Most expensive source of funding due to ranking behind 
all debt, with upside returns
- Can be in the form of:
  - Equity shareholding (public and private)
  - Some forms of hybrids/convertibles with mandatory conversion
- Institutional providers other than superfunds/fund managers can 
include:
  - Venture capital
  - Hedge funds
  - Private Equity
  - Family Offices

> No guarantee of getting returns

## DEVELOPMENT FINANCE

### Characteristics
**Debt**
- a loan
- contractual obligation to repay
- usually secured
- for a defined term
- interest payable

**Equity**
- an investment
- no surety of repayment
- unsecured
- in perpetuity 
- dividends payable only from profits

> Equity
> - when you own equity, owned forever until you liquidate it
> - right for an income stream of a loan is finite

### 2. Debt Finance Facilities
A. Term loans
B. Bank bills
C. Letters of credit (LCs)

> - letter of credit
>   - May go into a transaction where you show that you have capital but don't want to use it
>   - 'Knowing there is money in the bank for you'

### 2A. Term Loans
- Most common type of debt
- Flexibility to match interest/ principal repayments to available cashflow
- “Construction Finance” (Short term = to around 2 -4 years)
- “Term Debt” (longer term =  more than 4 years)

> Setup bank to manage your cashflow to not pay to the bank until time period
> - not usual to have capitalisation of interest
>
> Construction Finance
> - start the project and the builder goes broke and the construction company goes broke, you will be in trouble
> - in GFC - lots of developers went broke because a lot of the financiers did not have interest/demand to sell properties and fulfil construction finance loan
>   - Can destroy you if you get you funding wrong
>   - Do a development and it starts to file, convert the construction finance into term debt

### 2B. Bank Bills (Bills of Exchange)
- Negotiable instruments
- Commitment to repay at fixed future date (up to 180 days)
- Can roll over (at prices then current)
- Characteristics of a post-dated cheque
- Often used where there is a guaranteed takeout

> Structured a transaction to have an 80% loan e.g.
> - sale of other property will give you 20% capital
>   - bank bill will cover 20% equity for the short period
>   - Bad position if you don't sell the property

### 2C. Letter of Credit
- Guarantee by a financier used to underwrite borrowing of client 
to a third party
- Allow client flexibility to shop for best interest rates
- Not favoured by banks (low margin differentials)

### 3. Costs of Debt finance

- A. Interest
  - Interest rate = Lenders Cost of Finance +  Risk Margin
- B. Establishment Fee
- C. Line Fee
- D. Reimbursables

> If you are a riskier borrower and don't have a history of income, a standard bank may not give you a standard rate
> - another bank with a bigger risk profile may allow it
>
> Establishment fee
> - Massive fee potentially
> - Sometimes banks charge a non-refundable component of the establishment fee
>
> Line fee
> - opening up a line of credit, a fee is charged
> - creating a $100M development, and spend money in credit over a period of 2 years, e.g.
> - banks will secure $100M to draw down
> - banks will charge to secure the line of credit, and will
>
> Reimbursables
> - lawyers, town planning reports, banks will have experts and will want them paid for

### 3A. Repayment Structure
- Amortisation = repayment of debt gradually over the term (incl both interest and principal) - can be uniform or structured
- Interest Only = regular interest payments, principle at settlement (most common)
- Capitalised interest = all repaid at end

> Could be structured with unequal payments, might change based upon investment horizon
> 
> Interest only
> - benefit of capital growth, payoff the principle at the end of the payment
> - Popular form of debt financing until APRA changed the use of interest only loans

### 3A. Interest Options
Fixed
- Certainty about repayments 
- More expensive than floating
- Up to 5 years available
- Break costs apply with early settlement

> know exactly what your interest will be
> - Does not happen in Australia (only for 5 years)
> - In America the fixed interest rates stay for the duration of the loan
>   - If you borrow money from a bank and it's fixed, will see rates in the future to guess future bank rates
> - Borrow money on fixed interest and rates decrease, if you want to refinance banks will charge a break cost

Floating
- Take advantage of falling rates
- Borrower exposed to interest volatility
- Referenced to a published market rate (eg bank bills)
- No real break costs

### 3B. Other Costs: Establishment Fee
- Covers lender’s cost of processing application and documentation of loan
- Typically 0.5%
- Payable upfront
- Payable only if application approved 

### 3C.Other Costs: Line Fees
- Covers lender’s costs of ongoing loan administration
- Typically 1.0% pa
- Payable each year (or part year)

> Covers costs of administration

### 4. Debt - Security
Debt can be:
- recourse (ie with security)
- non-recourse (ie with no security)
- or limited recourse
Trend away from asset backed toward a cashflow and capacity to 
repay approach

> Historically is the gearing low enough that you will get money back?
> - what cash flows are associated with the development
> - What other income streams do they have? Do they have the capacity to pay?
>   - not a simple as LVR anymore

### 5. Types of Security
- Mortgage over property
- Security over other physical assets
- Charges over associated companies
- Rights to future cash flows
- Guarantees

### 6. Security Terms
- A. Registered mortgages
- B. Charges - fixed and floating
- C. Cash on deposit, bank guarantees or letters of credit
- D. Personal and directors’ guarantees
- E. Third party guarantees
- F. Cross-collaterisation

> Companies over personal property and property shares
> - Bank guarantee - if you are doing a development project to pay developer, secure a bank guarantee to the builder to satisfy that you can repay debt obligations
>   - Might create bank guarantees on the back of previous relations
>
> Personal and Directors Guarantees
> - SPV for development, start an LLC with paid up capital of $2
>   - When the company goes broke, gets paid up capital
>   - As Shareholder, structure the capital so that only company equity is required to pay debts
>   - Create a personal guarantee with the Director to finance debt obligations if default
>   - Could be guarantee from parents
>
> Cross-collaterisation
> - Debt for the bank to yur home
>   - have a business also, requires debt for generating business
> - Most banks will have a provision to cross-collaterise your debt, don't go to the same bank for business loans and personal home loans

### 6A. Registered Mortgages
- Real Property Act provides for a registered charge on land securing payment of a debt
- Banks usually insist on 1st mortgage
- 2nd mortgage risk dependent on 1st mortgagee’s conduct

### 6.C Cash, Bank Guarantees, LCs
- Still better to borrow than use direct cash (tax benefits)
- Banks generally lend to 100% of value
- Possible to fund development as 100% debt by effectively using these

### 7. Typical Development Debt
- Max loan to cost ratio ~ 70-75% of “hard” costs
- Secured by mortgage (plus guarantees?)
- Interest ~ 30 points (3%) above bank bills currently around ?%
- Interest payable progressively
- First draw-down after Building Approval

### 8. “Hard” vs “Soft” Costs
Hard Costs
- Construction
- Land plus all costs to BA
Soft Costs exclude:
- Agent commissions, advertising/ marketing, stamp duty, bank fees

### 9. Refinance on Completion
Construction Finance
- construction & take-out risks
- higher interest
- capitalised interest
- high levels of security

Term Debt
- only operating risks
- lower interest
- regular interest
- less harsh security

### 10. Basic Finance Terms
- Loan to value ratio (LVR)
- Loan security ratio (LSR) 
> multiple assets for security
- Peak debt and exposure
- Amortisation
- Interest: fixed/ floating, caps/ collars, swaps

### Debt Security Measures
-  Loan to Value Ration (LVR) = amount borrowed / value of the property
-  Loan Security Ratio (LSR) = amount borrowed / value of all securities

### Bank guidelines on LVR
- Residential housing  to 90%
- Income producing property  to 67%
- Also look at % of “hard costs” to 75%
- Specialised properties (eg hotels) to 50%

> Very expensive and rarely accessed
> - Income producing property, 

> ASSIGNMENT:
> Construction loan and term loan?
> - need to consider the loan structure

### Loan Agreement Issues
- Principal amount
- Term - repayment schedule
- Interest rate; fixed/floating, amount
- Timing of interest 
- Security; form, recourse and priority
- Performance covenants
- Default (eg increase interest 2-3%)

> how are they compounding the interest
>
> Performance covenant: 
> - need to have the house insured
> - Will not build anything on the land that is illegal


## Financial Metrics

### Equity Multiple
- Very basic metric 
- Doesn’t take into consideration discounting or time value of money
- Its simplicity makes it popular
The equity multiple is arrived at as follows: 
  - EM = Er/Ei 
where: 
  - Ei = equity invested 
  - Er = total cash returned (income and capital) 
  - EM = equity multiple

### Example
- The Equity Multiple measure is at its most appealing when dealing with a very simple 
investment focused on capital gain.
- Assume you paid a $100,000 deposit for a house in cash that cost you $1,000,000 
including all acquisition costs with an interest only loan of $900,000.
- You received no net income whilst you own the unit (ie rent covered all costs including 
debt payments which are interest only)
- Five years later you sold the unit for $1,650,000 and received $1,607,100 after costs of 
sale were paid.
- Total return $1,607,100 (income) - $900,000 (outstanding liabilities) = $707,100
- This would show an Equity Multiple of 7.07 
  - EM = Er/Ei 
  - EM = $707,100/$100,000
  - EM = 7.07

### Income return

Income Return
- This is the net rent or NOI received over the measurement period 
divided by the value at the beginning of the period.

> May have different LVR's for different projects
> Readings will have a good example

### Cash On Cash Yield
- The Cash-on-Cash Yield is the Income Return that an investor receives when they use debt.
- It represents the ratio of cash flow generated by the property to the amount of cash invested.
- It is useful to differentiate between real estate assets to determine which one has the highest return for any given amount of cash (ie equity) invested.

> yield for your equity

### Example

- Assume that an apartment block was bought for $40,000,000. 
- The investor put in $8,000,000 of equity and a major bank made a senior loan of $32,000,000 on an interest only basis.
- The passing net rent is $3,000,000 p.a. 
- The interest rate on the senior debt is 7%, meaning that $2,240,000 p.a. of the rent is needed to pay interest. The investor keeps the rest of the rent.
  - What is the LTV ratio?
  - What is the Initial Yield?
  - What is the Cash on Cash Yield? 

> TVR = 80%
> initial yield = passing rent/capital value = 3/40
> cash on cash yield = (760) / 8000 = 9.5%

### Mechanics of Leverage
- Analogy between financial and physical leverage proves helpful. 
- $4m in equity can purchase $10m in property.
- Leverage Ratio = value of underlying asset divided by the value  of the equity investment.

![alt text](assets\IMG33.PNG)

$$LR = \frac{V}{E} = \frac{L+E}{E}$$

> Need to understand what your leverage ratio is

### Effects of Leverage on the Expected Return
- Substantial leverage has the effect of substantially increasing the expected return. 
  - If an equity investor is able to borrow money at an interest rate lower than the expected return.
- Example:
  - Purchase Price: $10,000,000
  - Value Appreciates to: $10,200,000 (2%)
  - Income Return: $800,000
  - Interest Only Mortgage: 5%
  - Loan: $6,000,000
  - Equity Invested: $4,000,000

## LEVERAGE

### Tax
- Tax complicates things..

![alt text](assets\IMG36.PNG)

> Negative gearing
> - income less than total costs, claim tax deduction
>
> Tax for two things
> - capital gain
>   - Didn't always used to be taxed. In 1985 changed to be part of marginal tax rate
>   - Home ownership is more than 12 months, capital gains tax is halved
> - income
>
> after tax
> - less incomes tax, capital gains tax
> - AND GST
> - If you borrow money from property, you can deduct interest from income

### Why Tax Matters?
- Not all properties are taxed in the same way
  - Rental income or capital gain
  - Depreciation allowances
- Recapture on resale
- Not all owners are taxed in the same way
  - Different rates
  - Different offsets
  - Different treatment of losses from properties
  - Different ownership entities
- Passing through or paying tax 

> - have non-cash deductions in property
>   - depreciate fixtures over different rates
> - capital improvements are not a capital deduction up front


### How is Tax Payable Calculated?
Assessable income
-   - less deductions
- = Taxable income
-  x marginal tax rate
- = Basic tax payable
-   - less tax offsets
- = Tax payable

Either calculated 
- By treating the property as a separate investment, or
- The difference between tax paid with and without the property

> Interest is a deduction, but paying principle on your loan is not a deduction, e.g.

### Rental Income
- All Rent and other recurrent lease payments
  - On either cash/receipts basis or accruals basis
- Accruals may be applicable for rent paid in arrears
  - And trading profits of developers and other businesses

### Capital Gain
- Capital gains tax (CGT) is the tax you pay on a capital gain.
- It is not a separate tax, just part of your income tax.
- The most common way you make a capital gain (or capital loss) 
is by selling assets such as real estate, shares or managed fund 
investments.


### Deductions
- Expenses incurred in producing assessable income provided they are not 
capital, private or domestic
  - They can be claimed when they are incurred (due to be paid) or prepaid for the 
following year or they must be “properly referable” to the year of claim
- The latter for businesses 
- Statutory charges, insurance, fuel, management charges, etc as well as:
  - Loan interest
  - Repairs/maintenance
  - Depreciation allowances

### Deductions: Loan Interest
- Deductible provided that the money is borrowed to produce assessable income..
  - In the not too distant future…
- Negative gearing generally means:
  - That the loan interest exceeds net income; or that rental property deductions exceed 
assessable rental income
  - The tax loss shelters investor’s other income from tax
- Borrowing expenses are deductible over the shorter of the loan period or five 
years.

### Deductions: Repairs / Maintenance
- Not renewal or improvements (generally depreciable)
- Not initial repairs to enable the property to be rented
- Not payments into sinking funds until spent
- Not capital expenditure

### Deductions : Depreciation and Capital Expenditure (Capex)
- Capex:
  - The renewal of material different from the original: and / or
  - Work that has effectively been an improvements; and / or
  - Has increased the value of the asset; and / or
  - Expenditures to reduce the likelihood of further repair
