###  1. Describe the general nature of “Property”. 
Characteristics and traits, etc.
- Generally  property rights is the right of a person to the possession, use, enjoyment, and disposal of his or her property. 
- With respect to it's application of real estate, interest is a broad legal term used to denote a property right
  - Holder of an interest in real estate enjoys some right, or degree of control or use and may receive payment for the sale of such an interest
  - May be bought, sold or used as collateral for a loan


### 2.  What are the two main classifications of the “things” we call property?
- Real Property (realty) and personal property

### 3. Can Real Property be intangible? If yes, provide some examples.
- Easements can be intangible
  - non-posessory interest in land
  - Right to use the land that is owned or leased by someone else for some special purpose (e.g. as a right of way to and from one's property)
  - easement entails only a limited user privilege and not privileges associated with ownership
    - Gas and water meters, a small item but someone else has the right to access it
- Volumetric subdivision
  - Creating a volumetric subdivision (using space above or below the land)
    - Apartment building, multiple levels
  - Land subdivision: land can be physically subdivided and each parcel owned by a party
  - Strata title: a building can be divided into multiple lots and this is commonly referred to a "strata titling" or a "strata title subdivision"
- Leasehold of airspace
  - Land belongs to somebody, but someone is purchasing upper airspace.

### 4. What is meant by an “interest in property”?
- a right in relation to realty
- An interest in property can be created by the owners of real estate who may pledge and/or encumber their property in order to achieve an objective without giving up full ownership

### 5. What is the definition of an “estate” in the context of real property?
- The term estate means "all that a person owns"
- All realty owned as part of an individual's estate
- Real estate means all realty owned as a part of an individual’s estate. 
- Estates in real property is used to describe the extent to which rights and interests in real estate are owned. 
- A system of modifiers has evolved, based on English property law.
  - It describes the nature or <u>collection of rights and interests being described as a part of a transaction.</u> 
  - For example, a fee simple estate represents the most complete form of ownership of real estate.
  - Leasehold estate usually describes rights and interests obtained by tenants when leasing or renting a property.
  - Leasehold is possessory interest and involves the general right to occupy and use the property during the period of possession.


### 6. Provide two examples of Freehold Estates.
- Fee simple absolute in possession - free to divide up the fee into lesser estates, e.g.
  - represents the most complete for of ownership of real estate, whereas a leasehold estate usually describes rights and interest obtained by tenants when leasing or renting a property.
Life estate
- Freehold estate that lasts only as long as the life of the owner or the life (or a person or a job) or some other defined person

#### Difference between real estate, real property and personal property
- block of land, real estate. Real estate is used to refer to things that are not movable such as land and improvements permanently attached to the land
- The rights are real property. Legal right you have to the property. E.g. investments in REIT, e.g. Real property includes intangible assets, such as easements and land subdivision

### 7. How do Freehold Estates differ from Leasehold Estates?
Estates in possession are of two general types:
- freehold estates and 
- leasehold estates. 
- These types of estates are technically distinguished on the basis of the definiteness or certainty of their duration. 

Differences:
- A freehold estate lasts for an indefinite period of time; 
- A freehold estate connotes ownership of the property by the estate holder, 
- A leasehold estate, expires on a definite date;
whereas a leasehold estate implies only the right to possess and use the property owned by another for a period of time.

### 8. What is the similarity between a Reversion and a Remainder?
- Both examples of a future estate

### 9. What are the differences between a Reversion and a Remainder?
- A reversion exists when the holder of an estate in land (the grantor) conveys to another person (a grantee) a present estate in the property 
  - that has fewer ownership rights than the grantor’s own estate 
  - and retains for the grantor or the grantor’s heirs the right to take back, at some time in the future, the full estate that the grantor enjoyed before the conveyance.

- A remainder is the future estate (ie like a reversion) 
  - but rather than returning to the grantor the future estate will go to a third person and not back to the original grantor.


### 10.  Describe the Doctrine of Tenure and explain why it still applies today in Australia?

- The Doctrine of Tenure is a legal principle that originated in medieval England and is still applied in Australia today. 
- It refers to the concept of land ownership and tenure, meaning that individuals or groups who own land- hold it by way of a grant from the Crown
  - (the “Crown” is now referred to as the “State”).
- All other landowners hold their land as a form of tenure, meaning they have certain rights and obligations attached to their ownership. 
- For example, they may owe taxes or 
military service to the monarch in exchange for their landholding. 


- 
### 11.  What are the three sources for rights and obligations under a lease?
- Written contract (primary source of rights and obligations between the parties).
- Part VIII of the Property Law Act 1974 (QLD):
  - s 105 – tenant’s obligation to pay rent, keep in repair etc.
  - s 107 – landlord’s right to enter, repair etc
- Common law – implied terms and conditions:
  - Tenant right – quiet enjoyment
  - Landlord obligation - non derogation of grant


### 12. What are the main differences between a lease and a license?
- lease creates both property and contractual rights for the lessee
- a license only creates contractual rights for the licensee
- The lessee’s rights in relation to their use of the property can be enforced against the world at large.
- A licencee can only enforce rights in relation to their use of the property can be enforced against the licensor.
- A lease can be assigned by the lessee to a third party (subject to express provision in the lease prohibiting/restricting this).
- A licence cannot be assigned (unless it is associated with a lease – eg carparking licence as part of a retail lease).
- A lease grants exclusive possession of a premises (a licence is non-exclusive).

WHY THIS MATTERS – 
- it impacts your security of tenure if you need to occupy a property (ie leases is better than licences) and makes your income stream as an investment less secure.
