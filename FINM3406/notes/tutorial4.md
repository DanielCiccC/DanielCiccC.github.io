  - Difference factors such as property's location, size condition and amenities

NOTE:

Whatever way you do the valuation; it is usually base on past data
- current trends that are in place
- Whatever method we use to value it, it is based on historical data + current trends
- Easier to have an understanding of a future trends

### Q7 Define the terms "Potential Gross income", "Effective Gross Income" and "Net operating Income". What is the relationship between these terms and how does it affect the valuatuon of income producing property
- Potential Gross Income
  - The total income attributable to real property at full occupancy
  - It is the rent actually passing between tenant and landlord
  - Plus the estimated current market rent of any space vacant at the time
  - The passing rent may not not be the same as current market rent - especially when leases have been in place for some time
- Effective Gross Income

  - A credit loss would be represent by a tenant in default of rent payment
- Net Operating Income
  - the actual or anticipated net income remaining after deducting all operating expenses from effective gross income


Effective gross income - operating expenses = net operating income (NOI)

---
Market value = NOI / Cap rate

  - maintenance costs
  - market fluctuations and
  - Other potential risks that could impact the properties income generation potential
