# Real Estate Valuation

### Direct Comparison
- Simplest method
- Used when sales evidence is comparable enough to subject to allow direct comparison.
- Most popular method of valuation incorporated in the valuation of non income producing properties.
- Like with Like, Apples with Apples 
- Perfect World Scenario – Real challenge is adjustments for items that are not comparable (no two properties the same)


### Summation method
- Collation of value through the addition of constituent parts or components of a property.
- Used predominantly as a check method. Example:

|particulars | value
|--- | ---
| Land   | $1,000,000         
| Buildings |  $750,000 
| Other Imp | $250,000
| Total  |  $2,000,000 
- Land component treated as if it was vacant
- Building and improvements is their added value to the land (can be challenging to assess accurately – depreciated replacement cost)

### Before and After
- Used to assess compensation as result of compulsory acquisition, easement or encumbrance
- Simply the difference in value before and after the imposition of the event 
- Method requires two separate valuations
- One before and one after
- Can also be used in aggregating and/or subdividing properties

### Hypothetical Development
- Used to assess land under-developed but has: 
  - Highest and Best Use as a development site
  - Immediate potential for development
- Suited to assess englobo (in-globo) land 
- Method starts at the end and works backwards
- Hypothetical Development Equation: 
  - Value of Finished Product = land value + dev costs + finance costs + profit 
  - Value of Land = Value of Finished Product – (dev costs + finance costs + profit)
- Suitable only for static residual value calculations (single phase developments)

### Discounted cash flows
- Method involves assessing the present value of future cash flow
- Method based on subjective assumption
- Allows cash flow flexibility
- Useful in the assessment of complex and variable income properties
- Can be dangerous in the wrong hands – lots of assumptions

### Units of Production
- Common application for Rural properties
- Carrying capacity, Beast area value
- Applied to specialised commercial properties
  - hotel liquor consumption
  - bed rate in boarding houses
  - Room rate in hotel / motel


### Capitalisation method
- This valuation method is used for investment class properties
- This method has been widely accepted as being suitable for the estimation of Market Value. 
- Under this method, the Future Sustainable Annual Net Income of the subject property is converted to a capital sum (or value) by a **market derived multiplier**.  
- There is a basic assumption that the level of income will remain constant in perpetuity, or at least sufficiently long term to adopt a calculation of the income stream in perpetuity. 

### Capitalisation Rate
- Cap rate often referred to as yield or “All Risks Rate”
- It is a rate that represents all current and future expectations and benefits to be derived from a property.
- The rate can be used as a benchmark for the comparison of investments  
- Benefits - very simple to use and easy to compare with other assets
- Challenges – *integrity and availability of market data to derive rate*

- The formula used for the Capitalisation Method is:
$$CV = \frac{NI}{I}$$
- Where:
  - $CV$= Capital Value
  - $NI$ =  Net Annual Sustainable Income (also sometimes called Net Operating Income)
  - $i$  =  Capitalisation Rate (or Yield)
- The valuer needs to establish: 
  - The Open Market Rental Rate applicable to the property by reference to market rental evidence.  
  - The Cap Rate by analysis of recent sales evidence.  
- The factor is generally applied to the analysis/valuation of income streams (annuities) from real property held freehold in fee simple which are considered to be enjoyed in perpetuity.

> Note the Cap Rate is a market derived discount rate BUT is different from 
discount rate applied in a Discount Cash Flow.

### Capitalisation Rate – Years Purchase
- An alternate way of explaining the relationship between net income and property value is the number of years needed to buy the property. 
- Years Purchase is the reciprocal of the capitalisation rate:

$$\frac{1}{\text{Capitalisation Rate}} = \text{Years Purchase}$$

For example, using the same figures as previously:

$$\frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \; \; \text{years purchased}$$
