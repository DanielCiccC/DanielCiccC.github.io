### Asset class
- Grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and 
- Are subject to the same laws and regulations
- Instruments that often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace
    - when it comes to marking - maybe 0.5 points per point

### types of asset classes
- Bonds
- cash
- commodities (Gold, Silver, farm produce, etc.)
- Future
- Financial derivatives - defensive
- Property - growth asset
- Equities (stocks and shares) - growth asset
- Crypto currencies?




### Introduction to property - similarities and differences to other asset classes


Defensive assets
- Easily convert into cash - more liquid
- Less risky  

Growth assets
- Long term commitment, grows over longer time horizon


Difference between a defensive and a growth asset
- Growth assets may have been used to describe assets which were primarily invested in to provide potential capital growth, and 
- Defensive assets may have been used to describe assets

Real estate is similar to other asset classes
- Potential for appreciation: has the potential to appreciate in value over time
- Income generation: real estate, like stocks and bonds, can generate income through rental or lease payments
- Risk and volatility: real estate can be subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which can affect market value - subject to supply and demand
- Diversification: means of diversifying an investment portfolio, similar to how stocks and bonds can be used for diversification 
    â—‹ Build to rent, other methods of diversifying a portfolio
- Use of leverage: investors can use leverage to purchase real estate, similar to how margin can be used to purchase stocks
- Liquidity: real estate, like other asset classes, though it may not be as liquid as some other investment
- Demand and supply: influenced by demand and supply dynamics, which can affect is price and value over time

List seven ways real estate is different to other asset classes
- Tangibility: physical assets
- High transaction costs: typically involve higher transaction costs than other asset classes
- Illiquidity: real estate investments are typically less liquid than other asset classes, meaning it may take longer to buy or sell a property compared to stocks or bonds 
- Localised markets: real estate markets are often localised
- Management intensive, require active management, such as property management, tenant management, and regulatory compliance.
- High capital requirements.: Investing in real estate typically requires a significant amount of capital, which may not be the case for other asset classes 
- Sensitivity to interest rate: can be sensitive to changes in interest rates which may not be the case for other asset classes

Other factors:
- Intangible factors related to real estate- property rights, legal fees, legalities related to the property


Other decisions
- Size: large capital requirement (Big barrier to entry)
- Regulatory environment - high degree of regulatory control
- Uniqueness
- Timeline
- Property is a wasting asset
- Limited liquidity
- Quality of management impacts value. (Active management required as it is a wasting asset. Bad management destroys value, good management creates and retains value)
