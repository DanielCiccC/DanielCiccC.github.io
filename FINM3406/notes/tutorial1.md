### Asset class
- Grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and 
- Are subject to the same laws and regulations
- Instruments that often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace
    - when it comes to marking - maybe 0.5 points per point

### types of asset classes
- Bonds (fixed interest) – defensive	asset	
- Cash - defensive asset
- Commodities (Gold, silver etc) - defensive asset
- Futures – defensive asset
- Financial derivatives – defensive asset
- Property – growth asset (although also a wasting asset)
- Equities (stocks and shares) – growth asset
- Crypto currencies (very speculative but still possibly an asset class) 



### Introduction to property - similarities and differences to other asset classes


Defensive assets
- Easily convert into cash - more liquid
- Less risky  

Growth assets
- Long term commitment, grows over longer time horizon


### Difference between a defensive and a growth asset
- **"Growth assets"** – usually used to describe assets which were primarily invested in to provide potential capital growth, and
- **"Defensive assets"** – usually used to describe assets which broadly held their capital value and were invested in for access to reliable income streams.


### List seven ways that real estate is similar to other asset classes 

- Potential for appreciation: Like other asset classes, real estate has the potential to appreciate in value over time.
- Income generation: Real estate, like stocks and bonds, can generate income through rental or lease payments.
- Liquidity: Real estate, like other asset classes, can be bought and sold, though it may not be as liquid as some other investments.
- Risk and volatility: Real estate, like other asset classes, can be subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which can affect its value.
- Diversification: Real estate can be used as a means of diversifying an investment portfolio, similar to how stocks and bonds can be used for diversification.
- Use of leverage: Investors can use leverage to purchase real estate, similar to how margin can be used to purchase stocks.
- Demand and supply: Real estate, like other asset classes, is influenced by demand and supply dynamics, which can affect its price and value over time.

### Why are decisions about property generally more complex and time consuming compared to decisions about other asset classes?

- Size – large capital requirements (big barrier to entry)
- Regulatory environment – high degree of regulatory control and compliance (lots of direct obligations arising from ownership)
- Uniqueness (no two properties are exactly the same)
Time line – long time from inception to use/monetisation
- Property is a wasting asset – depreciation and obsolescence (built form)
- Limited liquidity (slow to sell)
- Quality of management impacts value (active management required as it is a wasting asset. Bad management destroys value, good management creates and retains value)


### List seven ways real estate is different to other asset classes
- Tangibility: physical assets
- High transaction costs: typically involve higher transaction costs than other asset classes
- Illiquidity: real estate investments are typically less liquid than other asset classes, meaning it may take longer to buy or sell a property compared to stocks or bonds 
- Localised markets: real estate markets are often localised
- Management intensive, require active management, such as property management, tenant management, and regulatory compliance.
- High capital requirements.: Investing in real estate typically requires a significant amount of capital, which may not be the case for other asset classes 
- Sensitivity to interest rate: can be sensitive to changes in interest rates which may not be the case for other asset classes

Other factors:
- Intangible factors related to real estate- property rights, legal fees, legalities related to the property


Other decisions
- Size: large capital requirement (Big barrier to entry)
- Regulatory environment - high degree of regulatory control
- Uniqueness
- Timeline
- Property is a wasting asset
- Limited liquidity
- Quality of management impacts value. (Active management required as it is a wasting asset. Bad management destroys value, good management creates and retains value)
