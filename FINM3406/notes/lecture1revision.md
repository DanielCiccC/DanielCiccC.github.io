# Real Estate as an Asset Class

### What is Real Estate?
- Tangible Asset (physical)
- When viewed as a tangible real estate includes:
    - Land (Cuius est solum, eius est uesque ad coelum et ad inferos)
      - Has to be real estate? Where does it start and stop?
    - Improvements on the land (appurtenances)
    - Does not include removable items (plant & equipment)
- Can it be Intangible (nonphysical)?
    - Contractual rights (ie leases, mortgages, options etc) - NO
    - Easements & Profit-a-prendre - YES
- Property Rights vs Contractual Rights
  - Privity of Contract vs Rights against the world
    - I can only enforce my rights against the person I have a contract with
    - Rights against the world - trespassing on your occupied property
- Bundle of Rights Theory
  - Ownership (private right enforceable against strangers)
  - Possession (possession is 9/10 of the law)
  - Control (what is built and what takes place)
  - Enjoyment (can use as see fit)
  - Exclusion (no trespassing)
  - Disposal (sale, lease or by will) & Destruction
- These rights are not unconstrained
  - Government controls (ie Planning, Environment, Heritage and Property Laws, Compulsory acquisition)
    - If the government decides it wants to build infrastructure on your land they can do it
  - Common law (ie nuisance)
  - Self imposed (Contracts – restrictive covenants, leases, mortgages, liens, caveats)

### Conceptual Frameworks for Ownership
- Capitalist perspective
  - Private ownership of property is an individual right 
    - Every individual has a right to privately own property
  - Liberal democratic society grundnorm (freedom and liberty)
    - grundnorm - foundational principle of liberal democracy
    - Property rights - communitarial obligation (heritage buildings, environmental protection etc.)
- Socialist perspective
  - State controls ownership and use of real estate
  - State allocates land based upon society needs
  - Private ownership limited – no right to buy or sell
- Communist perspective 
  - State owns all real estate. Private property is abolished
    - Determination of how it is used an allocated
  - State determines how real estate is used and allocated, with the goal of equal distribution of resources and wealth
  - Hybrid models exist


### Characteristics of Real Estate Markets
- Heterogeneous Products
  - Real Property is unique
    - Might be nearly identical in nearly every aspect, never the same
- Immobile Products
    - Real estate exists in a defined spatial context
    - Buildings can be relocated but land is immovable
- Localised Market
  - Markets differ from region to region
- Segmented Market
    - Segmentation can be based on use, size/scale and location
    - further drill down - layers that perform differently. 
- Private negotiations with high transaction costs
  - Time consuming, costly and complex
  - Private negotiations between purchaser and seller
  - In real estate in Australia, we are charged stamp duty - charge by the government to 'stamp' your enforce your contract
    - Based upon the value of your contract
