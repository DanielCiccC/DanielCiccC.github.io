### Fund investment strategies

### Core
- Primarily invest in:
  - Stabilised existing properties 
  - Current cash flows
  - Low vacancy
  - Located in major metropolitan areas
- Invest in a wide variety of property types
- Use limited leverage - low risk

### Core Plus
- Core plus properties can be a minor component of core fund:
  - Core assets in need of minor improvements
  - “a B property in an A location”
  - Core property that includes current undeveloped land 

### Value Add:
- Take on more risk by purchasing properties which:
  - Carry current vacancies
  - Have upcoming major tenant rollovers
  - In need of renovation and capital outlay
- Funds create value by renovating and leasing up the property 
- Use more leverage compared to core plus

### Opportunistic
- Take on even more risk by doing ground up development projects
- Expose the fund to additional construction risks:
  - Entitlements
  - Construction delays
  - Cost overruns
  - Complex JV management issues, etc. 
- High degree of financial leverage
- May be less diversified and concentrate in certain geographic areas or property types
- Strategy may involve purchasing “distressed property assets”


## A-REIT
- A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is an investment vehicle that allows investors to purchase an interest in a diversified and professionally managed portfolio of real estate that is listed on the stock exchange. 
- A-REITs were established to allow investors to gain exposure to high-grade real estate both domestically and offshore, without the need for large levels of capital, and with the addition of liquidity.

#### REIT characteristics
- Legal Form
  - No specific REIT rules in Australia   - can be listed or unlisted
    - May be sector specific or diversified 
  - Corporations Act states a REIT must be registered as a Managed Investment Scheme 
- Capital Requirements
  - No capital requirements for a REIT if listed (but must meet ASX requirements)
  - Capital requirements for a manager
- Listing Requirements
  - No listing requirements – REITs can be listed or unlisted
- Restrictions on investors
  - No investment restrictions on investors
- Restrictions on foreign assets
  - No restrictions on foreign assets
- Distribution requirements
  - Undistributed income on gains taxed at 46.5%
    - gains are taxed at your prevailing personal tax rate
  - Full distribution of income and gains by REITS generally occurs

### REIT Distributions

- Trusts distribute 90% to 100% of earnings
- AREIT trusts do not have franking credits – income is not taxed at trust
- Distributions taxed at the individual income tax rate
- REIT distribution includes a tax deferred component
- Tax deferred component – represents the return of capital rather than income
  - Plant and equipment depreciate which reduces taxable income - can be distributed to beneficiaries of the REIT - can get some of the capital back too
- As REITs collect income – manager can decide if the payments made to investor are income collected or capital invested

### A-REIT forms
- Broadly speaking, A-REITs comprise one of two forms:
  - Externally Managed (passive); or
  - Stapled (active).

RHS:
- investors put money into the trust
- trustees purchase properties and hire a manager
- entity managing the property is not necessarily the same as the trustee that owns the property

LHS:
- unit holder holds shares in the trust and the management company
  - have an equity position in the company also
- unit in the trust, and shares in the management company
- most common

### Stapled securities

- Some trusts adopt hybrid structures called ‘stapled securities’ funds.
- Stapled securities A-REITs provide investors with exposure to a funds management and/or a property development company, as well as a real estate portfolio. 
- A share in a stapled securities fund usually consists of one trust unit and one share in the funds management company. 
- These securities are ‘stapled’ and cannot be traded separately. 
- The trust holds the portfolio of assets, while the related company carries out the fund’s management functions and/or manages any development opportunities.

### Externally Managed model:
- Management taken on by separate entity to the property trust
- Slowly collapsing over time
- Often conflicts of interest between management and trust
- Can provide better resourcing and management services than some REITs have capacity for

## Modern Portfolio Theory

#### Capital Return
The change in capital value of an investment over a holding period as a percentage between any change in capital value and the purchase price or value at the beginning of the measurement period.

Capital Return= 
$$\frac{CV_{1} - CV_{0}}{CV_{0}} \times 100$$

#### Income Return
- Net income over the measurement period divided by the purchase price or capital value at the beginning of the measurement period.

Income return = 
$$\frac{NI}{CV_{0}} \times 100$$

#### Total Return
Percentage relationship between any capital gain or loss and income over the capital value at the beginning of the measurement period. 
- True return to the investor on their money.


Total return = 
$$\frac{CV_{1} - CV_{0} + NI}{CV_{0}} \times 100 $$


CV = capital value at the beginning of the measurement period
CV1 = capital value at end of the measurement period
NI = net income received during the period

### Initial Yield and Reversionary Yield
**Initial Yield**
- The income yield for the asset. Shows the ratio of the current passing rent to the current property value
    - IY = passing rent / property value
    - passing yield - how much rent I am currently versus from the current property value

**Reversionary Yield**
  - The market yield for the asset. Shows the ratio of the market rent to the current property value (on properties rented below market)
  - RY = market rent / property value

**Example**
A property is valued at $2.5m and has a current net income of $150,000 p.a. The assessed market income for the property is $175,000 p.a. Compute the initial yield and reversionary yield for the asset.

$$IY = \frac{\$150,000}{\$2,500,000}$$

$$RY = \frac{\$175,000}{\$2,500,000}$$

### Asset Yields vs Asset Returns
- Yield reflects the relationship between a current net income and the purchase price and does not take into account any capital loss or gain made.
- Return usually reflects any income, expenditure and/or capital gain or loss made on investments.
- Return gives a clear indication of the financial position of the investor.
- Yields are used to estimate the market value of an investment while a return is used as a means of comparing the financial attractiveness of different investments to an investor.

### Portfolio returns
- Return is a weighted average of expected return on each asset.
- Consider two assets with weights, w 1 w 2 and returns r 1 r 2 .

Portfolio return:
$$r_{p}=(w_{1}r_{1})+(w_{2}r_{2})+...$$
