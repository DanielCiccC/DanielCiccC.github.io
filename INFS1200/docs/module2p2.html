<h2 id="steps-for-mapping">Steps for mapping</h2>
<h3 id="1-regular-entity">1. Regular Entity</h3>
<p>For each entity type</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a relation</li>
<li>Choose a key as the primary key</li>
<li>Include all simple attributes (e.g., a3 and a4) which arenot composite (e.g.,a2), derived or multivalued (e.g., a5)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets%5CIMG46.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<h3 id="2-weak-entity">2. Weak Entity</h3>
<p>For each weak entity type</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a relation</li>
<li>Set its primary key as the combination of the primary keys of owner
entities and its own partial key.</li>
<li>Include a foreign key from the relation to the primary key of the relation of its owner entity types.</li>
<li>Include all simple attributes which are not composite, derived or multivalued.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets%5CIMG47.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<h3 id="3-binary-11-relationship">3. Binary 1:1 Relationship</h3>
<p>For each binary 1:1 relationship type</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose one of the participating entity types (preference is given to entity types with total participation)</li>
<li>Include a foreign key from the chosen entity type back to the primary keys of the relation of the other entity type.</li>
<li>Include all the simple attributes of the relationship type to the relation of the chosen entity type.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets%5CIMG48.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<h3 id="step-4-binary-1n-relationship">Step 4. Binary 1:N Relationship</h3>
<p>For each (non-weak) binary 1:N relationship type</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the participating entity type at the N-side of the relationship type</li>
<li>Include a foreign key to the entity type on the N-side. This foreign key should be the primary key of the entity type on the 1-side.</li>
<li>Include any simple attributes of the relationship type as attributes of the relation of the N side.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets%5CIMG49.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<h3 id="step-5-binary-mn-relationship">Step 5. Binary M:N Relationship</h3>
<p>For each binary M:N relationship type</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new relation</li>
<li>Include foreign keys from relation to the primary key of the participating
entity types</li>
<li>The combination of foreign keys will form the primary key of R</li>
<li>R can have its own attributes that contribute to the primary key</li>
<li>Include any simple attributes of R as attributes of the new relation
<img src="assets%5CIMG50.PNG" alt="alt text"></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-6-multivalued-attributes">Step 6: Multivalued Attributes</h3>
<p>For each multivalued attribute:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new relation.</li>
<li>Include a foreign key from the relation to the primary key of the associated entity type.</li>
<li>The primary key is the combination of the multivalued attributes and the primary key of its associated entity type.</li>
<li>If the multivalued attribute is composite, include its simple components.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets%5CIMG51.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<h3 id="step-7-n-ary-relationships">Step 7: N-ary Relationships</h3>
<p>For each N-ary relationship type</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new relation</li>
<li>Include foreign keys from the relation to the primary key of the participating entity types</li>
<li>The combination of foreign keys from entity types with many cardinality will form the primary key</li>
<li>R can have its own attributes that contribute to the primary key</li>
<li>Include any simple attributes of R as attributes of the new relation</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-8-super-and-subclasses-mapping">Step 8: Super and Subclasses Mapping</h3>
<p>The following method works for total/partial and disjoint/verlapping subclasses.
For each subclass entity type</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a relation</li>
<li>The primary key of each of the subclasses is the primary key of the superclass.</li>
<li>Include a foreign key from the relation to the primary key of the relation of its superclass entity type.</li>
<li>Include all simple attributes which are not composite, derived or multivalued.</li>
</ol>
