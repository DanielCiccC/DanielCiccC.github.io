### Learning Objectives

1. Apply system architecture principles to design and deploy Web Information Systems (WIS) solutions.
2. Evaluate and articulate the scope, complexity, and key considerations in the design and 
implementation of Web Information Systems.
3. Design and program Web Information Systems (WIS) with server-side functionalities.
4. Develop responsive Web-based, database-driven applications using efficient and effective 
technologies.
5. Evaluate and justify the suitability of Web Information Systems solutions in various contexts, 
considering factors such as user needs and technical constraints.
6. Judge in which situations WIS solutions are more or less appropriate.
7. Critically analyze current issues and emerging trends in Web Information Systems development, and
predict potential impacts on future practices and technologies.

### Exam tips

- Covers the concepts of web information systems/web applications
- Combination of multiple choice questions (32) and free text questions (5)
- Weighting 30 marks
- Identity Verified Assessment Hurdle
  - You must get >=15 marks to pass the course
  - You must have your Student ID
- No specific questions on PHP syntax as some students have used other 
frameworks and also because ‘programming’ a web application is already 
accessed by the Project Assessment Item and the Code Review.

> multiple choice and free text
> - about web concepts and definitions

# Exam tips
- Basic Linux commands e.g. ls, cd, mv, cp, nano, sudo, mkdir, chmod
- Basic Nginx config e.g. root and location,
- Definitions and Acronyms e.g. CSS, HTML, HTTP, SSH, HTTP Status codes, etc
- MVC Architecture
- Relational databases, database design and SQL queries
- Forms and how to process the data
- HTML tags e.g. Form, a, img, link, table, p, etc 
- How to build a web application given requirements/features?
- All of the topics covered in Lectures and Labs
- Except Week 7 Gen AI Prompting and AWS Guest Lecture (but some of the AWS Lab definitions are important) 22

>   - definitions in the lab


> From ed discussion:
> 
> The previous courses had different course coordinators. I have made a lot of changes and added new content based on what a web developer should know eg new sections on CRUD (in much more detail), Migrations, RESTful API's and Accessibility. The labs also have a lot more detail.
> 
> The most that can be asked about GenAI is the things to consider before using it - from the Week 3 slides. There won't be any questions on prompting, calling LLM API's or creatively thinking about integrating GenAI features into your web app. 
> 
> In Week 13 there will be tips and a practice quiz in the Lecture and Labs.
