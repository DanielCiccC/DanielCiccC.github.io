# MVC â€“ Creating CRUD Applications

### Base Template View
- Create a HTML template that keeps the full page HTML (including the Header and Footer)
- Define sections for content
- Can have multiple sections
- Other views can inherit the template and then just need to include content for the sections

> - serves to reduce duplication
> - keep similar files together

> - only done one here, could have any number of them

> - this is the actual HTML I am giving for this section
> - base template is a skeleton with slots - placeholder for page content
>   - create the outline of these components separately


## Create Read Update Delete (CRUD)

- Definition of CRUD: 
  - CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  These are the four basic functions of persistent storage.
- Foundation of User Interfaces: 
  - CRUD operations form the foundation of user interfaces in many applications, enabling users to interact directly with data.
- Ubiquity in Web Applications: 
  - Almost every web application has a backend database and uses CRUD operations to interact with the data.
- APIs and CRUD: 
  - Many RESTful APIs are designed around CRUD operations, mapping HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) to CRUD functionalities.
- Database Operations: 
  - At the database level, CRUD corresponds to SQL commands INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, respectively.

> - Design User interfaces to build things


### E.g. Customer app

Need an:
- Add button that displays an Add form
- Edit button in each row
- Delete button in each row
- Display the status of the last operation

### Designing a Database

- Each table must represent a single subject
- No data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table, i.e., No data redundancy 
- All non-key attributes in a table are dependent on the primary key
- Each table is void of insertion, update, deletion anomalies
- Objective of normalisation is to ensure that all tables are in at least 3 rd  Normal Form (3NF)

### First Normal Form
- To achieve 1NF, we need to ensure that each column contains atomic values and there are no repeating groups. 
- In this case, we can split the table into two separate tables: "Students" and "Enrollments".

### Second Normal Form
- To achieve 2NF, we need to ensure that all non-key columns depend on the entire primary key. 
- In the "Enrollments" table, the primary key is a combination of "StudentID" and "CourseID". 
- However, the course details (CourseName, CourseCredits, InstructorName) depend only on the "CourseID". 
- To resolve this, we can split the "Enrollments" table further into "Enrollments" and "Courses" tables.

- **remove partial dependencies**

### Third normal form
- To achieve 3NF, we need to ensure that there are no transitive dependencies.

Normalisation Overview
**Form** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|**1NF** | **Outcome**: Identifying non-atomic values from relations. <br> **Test**: Relation should have no multivalued attributes or nested relations.
| **2NF** | **Outcome**: Identifying partial dependencies, which helps remove some anomalies. **Test**: LHS of any non-trivial FD in F+ is not a proper subset of a candidate key, or RHS is a prime attribute
| **3NF** | **Outcome**: Identifying partial and transitive dependencies, which helps remove most anomalies **Test**: LHS of any non-trivial FD in F+ is a superkey, or RHS is a prime attribute. |
| **BCNF** | **Outcome**: Identifying all anomalies at the cost of not preserving all FDs**Test**: LHS of any non-trivial FD in F+ is a superkey.
