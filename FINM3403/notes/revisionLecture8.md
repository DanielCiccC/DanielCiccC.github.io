### Net present Value
- The NPV is the present value of future cash flows 
discounted at an appropriate rate minus the initial 
net cash outlay for the project. 
- In mathematical terms, the formula for net present 
value is: 

$$NPV = -I_{0} + \sum ^{ \infty}_{t=1}\frac{CF_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}$$

- Projects with a positive NPV should be accepted; negative NPV projects should be rejected. 
- The discount rate is the expected rate of return on projects of similar risk.
