### Tax Neutrality

- A tax scheme is tax neutral if it meets three criteria:
  - **Capital import neutrality** (exclusion method): the tax burden on an MNC subsidiary should be the  same regardless of where in the world the MNC in incorporated.
  - **Capital export neutrality** (credit method): the tax scheme does not incentivize citizens to move their money abroad.
  - National neutrality: taxable income is taxed in the same manner by the taxpayerâ€™s national tax authorities regardless of where in the world it is earned.

### Types of Taxation

- (Corporate) Income tax
  - An income tax is a direct tax, or a tax that is paid directly by the taxpayer upon whom it is levied.
- Withholding tax
  - Tax on passive income like dividends, interest, royalties
  - Tax treaty between Australia & US means, American investors are subject to 10% withholding tax on dividends they receive. This tax would be rebated as a tax credit in their home jurisdiction (i.e., the US). 
- Value-added tax/Goods & Services Tax
  - An indirect tax

### Withholding Tax

- Withholding taxes are withheld from the payments a corporation makes to the taxpayer. 
- The taxes are levied on passive income earned by an individual or corporation of one country within the tax jurisdiction of another country.
- Passive income includes income from dividends and interest, royalties, patents, or copyrights.
- In Australia, the tax on dividends is 15% (may depend on tax treaty), on royalties/patents/copyright it is 5% 
- A withholding tax is an indirect tax.
