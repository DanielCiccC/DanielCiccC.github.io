# International Diversification

### Why Invest Overseas?
- Security returns are much less correlated across countries than within a country.
  - This is so because economic, political, institutional, and even psychological factors affecting security returns tend to vary across countries, resulting in low correlations among international securities.
  - Business cycles are often highly asynchronous across countries.

### Foreign Exchange Returns
- An illustration with Australian stock returns
  - The total return reflects not only the appreciation in the USD stock price but also the change in the USD (appreciation in this case)
- The formula for the total return is

$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = [(1+R^{MSFT}_{AUD})(1+\Delta S_{USD})]$$

Where
$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = \frac{232.13-55.48}{55.48} = 3.18$$

And 
$$\Delta S_{USD} = \frac{1.5625-1.3765}{1.3765}=0.1351$$

- $MSFT$ - microsoft share

$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = [(1+3.18)(1+0.1351)]$$

**General Formula**
- The total return of the foreign investment reflects not only the 
appreciation of the foreign asset, but also the appreciation (or 
depreciation) of the foreign currency relative to the home 
currency.
- The formula for the total return is: 

$$R^{Asset(FC)_{HC}} = [(1+R^{Asset(FC)})(1+R_{FC})]-1$$

where 
- HC = home currency; 
- FC = foreign currency relative to home currency (FC is in the denominator). 
- Asset (FC) means the asset value is in FC

### Foreign Returns and risk

### Adding up volatilities
- As shown in the previous slide, the volatility of currency returns affects the volatility of USD return on a foreign equity (last column). But volatilities of FC market returns & currency returns are not additive. Why?

$$cov(x, y) = \rho_{x,y} \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}$$


If correlation ($\rho$) = 1, the volatility of the dollar return is the sum 
of the foreign equity volatility and currency return volatility.

### Key results of portfolio theory
- The extent to which risk is reduced by portfolio diversification depends on the correlation of assets in the portfolio.
- As the number of assets increases, portfolio variance becomes more dependent on the covariances (or correlations) and less dependent on variances.
- The risk of an asset when held in a large portfolio depends on its return covariance (or correlation) with other assets in the portfolio.
