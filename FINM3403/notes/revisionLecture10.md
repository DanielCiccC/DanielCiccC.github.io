# International Diversification

### Why Invest Overseas?
- Security returns are much less correlated across countries than within a country.
  - This is so because economic, political, institutional, and even psychological factors affecting security returns tend to vary across countries, resulting in low correlations among international securities.
  - Business cycles are often highly asynchronous across countries.

### Foreign Exchange Returns
- An illustration with Australian stock returns
  - The total return reflects not only the appreciation in the USD stock price but also the change in the USD (appreciation in this case)
- The formula for the total return is

$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = [(1+R^{MSFT}_{AUD})(1+\Delta S_{USD})]$$

Where
$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = \frac{232.13-55.48}{55.48} = 3.18$$

And 
$$\Delta S_{USD} = \frac{1.5625-1.3765}{1.3765}=0.1351$$

- $MSFT$ - microsoft share

$$R^{MSFT}_{AUD} = [(1+3.18)(1+0.1351)]$$

**General Formula**
- The total return of the foreign investment reflects not only the 
appreciation of the foreign asset, but also the appreciation (or 
depreciation) of the foreign currency relative to the home 
currency.
- The formula for the total return is: 

$$R^{Asset(FC)_{HC}} = [(1+R^{Asset(FC)})(1+R_{FC})]-1$$

where 
- HC = home currency; 
- FC = foreign currency relative to home currency (FC is in the denominator). 
- Asset (FC) means the asset value is in FC
