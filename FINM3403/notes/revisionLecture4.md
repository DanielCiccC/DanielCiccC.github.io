# Foreign Currency derivatives

- These are financial instruments whose value depends on an observable value
- Derivatives include:
  - Options: A contract that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to transact in an asset.
  - Futures: A contract to buy or sell a commodity at a point in the future. Changes in prices in the commodity are settled daily.
  - Swaps: A contract in which two parties exchange cashflows from different financial instruments.


### Futures and Forwards
Currency forward and futures contracts both represent an obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of a specified currency some time in the future at an exchange rate determined now.

- | **Futures contracts** | **Forwards Contract**
--- | --- | ---
Markets: | Prices determined in centralised exchanges | Decentralised interbank market
Trading Hours: | Most trading during exchange hours | Open somewhere around the world
| Contract size | Standardised sizes depending on currency | Standard size of $1m etc. and can be tailored
| Contract maturity | Fixed delivery dates: 3rd Wed. of March, June Sept or Dec. | Fixed maturities (1, 3, 6 or 12 months) or can be tailored to specifications
Quotation: | American terms (USD/FC) | American (USD/FC) or European (FC/USD)
| Settlement | Delivery of underlying fx is feasible, but almost never occurs. Position closed out by taking an offsetting position | Delivery of foreign exchange normally takes place
| Security against default | Clearing houses stand behind traders | Assets of bank
| Required collateral | Margin requirements ("Performance bond") | Deposit required if not standing relations with bank
| Cash flows | Occur daily because of "market-to-market" feature | No cash flows until forward contract matures

### Options contracts

Options contracts give the option holder the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified amount of the underlying asset (currency; stock) at a pre-determined price (exercise or strike price).

### Basics of Options
'The right, but not the obligation'

- Types of Options
  - Call: gives the holder the right to buy
  - Put: gives the holder the right to sell
- An **American option**  gives the buyer the right to exercise the option at any time between the date of writing and the expiration or maturity date. 
  - American option will always be more expensive than an equivalent European option (of the same terms)
- A **European option** can be exercised only on the expiration date, not before. 
- The **exercise or strike price (X)**, which is the exchange rate at which foreign currency can be purchased (call) or sold (put). 
- The **premium**, cost, price, or value of the option itself (paid in advance by the buyer to the seller).
- The underlying or actual spot exchange rate in the market.
