# Foreign Currency derivatives

- These are financial instruments whose value depends on an observable value
- Derivatives include:
  - Options: A contract that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to transact in an asset.
  - Futures: A contract to buy or sell a commodity at a point in the future. Changes in prices in the commodity are settled daily.
  - Swaps: A contract in which two parties exchange cashflows from different financial instruments.


### Futures and Forwards
Currency forward and futures contracts both represent an obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of a specified currency some time in the future at an exchange rate determined now.
