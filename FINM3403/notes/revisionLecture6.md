# Hedging Economic Exposure

### Change in real exchange rate
- Suppose inflation in Australia (UK) over the next year is 4% (8%). Also, the nominal exchange rate changes in line with Relative PPP predictions.

$$s_{t+1}=s_{t}\cdot \frac{1+\pi _{\$}}{1+\pi _{\pounds}}=1.30\cdot \frac{1.04}{1.08}=\$1.2519 / \pounds$$

- The £ weakens by 3.7%
  -  What is the new Real Exchange Rate?
- New price levels are $15,600 (=15,000×1.04) and £12,960 (= £12,960×1.08) in Australia and the UK respectively

$$E_{t+1} = \frac{\$1.2519/\pounds}{\frac{\$15600}{\pounds 129600}} = 1.04$$

- Notice, the real exchange rate has not changed. This is because *relative PPP holds*. This keeps deviations from absolute PPP constant.

### Real exchange rate change
- Real exchange rate, E, can change over time. This is given as

$$\Delta E = \frac{E^{A/B}_{t+1}-E^{A/B}_{t}}{E^{A/B}_{t}} = \frac{E^{A/B}_{t+1}}{E^{A/B}_{t}} -1$$

$$1+\Delta E = \frac{(1+\Delta s_{t+1})\cdot (1+\pi_{B,t+1})}{1+\pi_{A,t+1}}$$

- If the % change in E is positive, we have real appreciation of B.
- If the % change in E is negative, we have real depreciation of B.

### Real exchange rates and Profitability

- Real Exchange Rates affect real profitability which is the nominal profits divided by the price level.
  - Why is real profitability important?
- Consider the case of an Australian exporter of mangoes (M). His costs are incurred in AUD. 

**Revenue from sales:**

$$P(M, \$) \cdot Q(M, Aus)$$

**Revenue from French Sales**

$$P(M, €) \cdot Q(M, Fr) \cdot S(\$ /€)$$

**Cost of Production**

$$C(M, \$) \cdot [Q(M, Fr) + Q(M, Aus)]$$

- The exporter's *real* export revenue from sales to France is

$$ \frac{P(M, €) \cdot Q(M, Fr) \cdot S(\$ /€)}{P(\$)}$$

$$ = \frac{S(\$ /€) \cdot P(€)}{P(\$)} \cdot \frac{P(M, €)}{P(€)} \cdot Q(M, Fr)$$

- The exporter’s real export revenue depends on three factors
1. The real exchange rate;
2. The relative price of mangoes in France; and
3. The quantity of mangoes sold in France

### The Source of Economic Exposure
- Economic exposure arises when the value of the firm is affected by 
changes in the Real exchange rate. Exchange rates affect the value of 
the firm through their impact on
  - Revenues;
  - Costs; and
  - Competitive position
- It is the extent of sensitivity of the Value of a firm to an unexpected exchange to real exchange rates. 

### A Real-World Example: Honda Motors
- Honda used to manufacture all its automobiles in Japan and ship them to the U.S. 
- U.S. demand declined with yen appreciation

- In January 1993, exchange rate was about 125 ¥/$.  By April, it fell to 113-114 ¥/$ range 
  - ~$11,602
- NY Times says that Japanese manufacturers would have to “take stern measures to reduce their costs and improve their efficiency.”
- June 1993 dollar fell to about 110 ¥/$ 
  - ~$11,364
- End of summer of 1993, 100 ¥/$
  - ~$12,500

- In July 1993, Japanese auto exports were 14% below previous year’s level.  
- The New York Times reported Japanese manufacturers were shifting production to U.S. 
- Honda posted a 55% drop in pre-tax profit for quarter ending June 30, 1993. 
- Honda has built manufacturing plants in the U.S. to 
produce automobiles for sale there. 


### Impact of Economic Exposure
- A strong dollar can make imports look cheap to Australian purchasers.  
  - Can bring new competition for Australian producers.
- Exchange rates can affect the price a firm pays for inputs imported from foreign countries. 
  - **Raise prices** (lower demand) or earn lower profits?
- Exchange rates can affect the foreign demand for a firm’s product. 
  - Weak dollar can make Australian exports attractive.
  - Increase in foreign demand can also increase Australian prices if production doesn’t adjust fast enough. 

### Quantifying Economic Exposure
- PV of firms profits/CFs is given as  

$$ V = \sum ^{T} _{j=1} \frac{CF_{j}}{(1+r)^{j}}$$

- It measures the marginal impact on firm value by an unexpected change in the (AUD/FC) real exchange rate.

### Natural Hedges
- Ford shifting production to Asia

- Toyota has insulated itself to some extent against dollar fluctuations
  - It builds 60% of the cars sold in North America in North America
- Michelin, the world’s largest tire maker, has 40% of its annual sales in 
North America.
  - Most of the imported raw materials used by Michelin are also priced in dollars

### Exchange rate Changes and Profit Margins

- Another way to state the findings is: Foreign customers do observe exchange-rate driven changes in prices, but the Japanese firms moderate the extent of these changes by altering their profit margins.

Why would this make sense?
- A firm that has found its profit-maximizing price in each market 
and will attempt to keep its goods at that price. (Cares about 
maintaining market share.)
- Thus, firms are inclined to absorb currency swings into their 
profit margins to stabilize prices seen by foreign customers.
