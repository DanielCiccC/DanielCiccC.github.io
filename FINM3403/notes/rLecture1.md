# Introduction & Exchange Rate Conventions

### Exchange rate
- A foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency.
- A foreign exchange quotation (or quote) is a statement of willingness to buy or sell at an announced rate. 
  - Market makers - foreign currency dealers and brokers
  - binding quotes for a few minutes

> - normally quote to four digits
> - normally settles T+2
> - have all the contributors at the bottom, with their bid/ask

### Exchange rate terminology
**Terminology** | **Description**
| --- | --- |
**Spot Rate** | The exchange rate at which trades are executed immediately in the interbank market. About a third of all FX trading is done in this market.
**Value Date** | Value date for a spot transaction is the date on which parties receive the funds they have purchased
**Bid Price** |  Price at which the dealer is willing to buy a currency 
from you (i.e., client)
**Ask Price** |  Price at which the dealer is willing to sell a currency to you (i.e., client)
**Direct Quote** | Home currency per unit of foreign currency (FC)
**Indirect Quote** | Foreign currency (FC) per unit of Home currency
**Cross-rate** | an exchange rate that does NOT involve the USD
**bid-ask spread** | The difference between the bid and ask prices. It represents a “round-trip” transaction and is the cost of entering into the transaction.

- It is always the case that the Ask Price > Bid Price. The difference is the Bid-Ask spread
- The less traded and more volatile a currency, the greater is the spread. 

### Bid-Ask Prices

$$\text{USDCHF} \; \; \; .8505-0.8507*$$
USD - base currency
CHF - Quote currency

$\text{USDCHF}_{bid} = 0.8505$ - the rate at which the bank will buy USD (base currency) in exchange for CHF (gives customer swiss francs)

$\text{USDCHF}_{ask} = 0.8507$ - the rate at which the bank will sell USD (base currency) for CHF (receives swiss francs from customer)

### Reciprocals:
- A direct bid is the reciprocal of an indirect ask.
- A direct ask is the reciprocal of an indirect bid.

### Triangular Arbitrage


**Bank** | Amount | Amount 
| --- | --- | --- |
Citibank | $1.7395/£   |  £0.5749/$
Barclays Bank | €0.8408/$   |  $1.1893/€
Dresdner Bank (Actual) Cross-rate |  €1.4381/£  |  £0.6954/€

Look at this (convert) to the base currency amount.
- purchase the greater of the spot rate of the base currency first, and purchase (sell) the spot rate of the second exchange rate after
- In terms of £/€ (with € as base currency), actual cross rate (£0.6954/€) greater than derived cross rate (\$1.1893/€ x £0.5749/\$)
