### Spot market
The	spot market	involves almost	immediate purchase or sale of foreign exchange
 Quoted in direct or indirect terms
 - Direct: Home currency per unit of foreign currency (FC)
 - Indirect: Foreign currency (FC) per unit of Home currency

$S(j/k)$ will refer to the price of one unit of currency $k$ in terms of currency $j$.

**Cross-exchange rate** is an exchange between a currency pair where neither currency is the U.S. dollar

### Bid-Ask spread
- Bid - the price in which the bank dealer will pay (buy) the currency for
- Ask - the price in which the bank dealer will sell the currency for

### Calculating the cross-exchange rate Bid-Ask spread
- use two direct or indirect quotes

$$S^{a}(\pounds / SFr) = S^{a}( \pounds / \$  ) \times S^{a}(\$/SFr)$$

- a direct bid is the reciprocal of an indirect ask
- a direct ask is the reciprocal of an indirect bid

### Forward market
- Contracting today for the future purchase or sale of foreign exchange
- $F_{N}(j/k)$, the price of one unit of currency $k$ in terms of currency $j$ for delivery in $N$ months
- under certain conditions the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the expected spot exchange rate $N$ months into the future. 
  - Trading at a premium to the dollar in American terms, we can say the markets expect the US dollar to *depreciate* relative to the Swiss franc
  - When the dollar is trading at a *discount* to the Swiss franc, we can say the market expects the Swiss franc to appreciate, or become more valuable, relative to the dollar. It costs fewer francs to buy a dollar forward.

### Forward premium
- Express the premium or discount as an annualised percentage deviation from the spot rate

- There are three ways to express forward rates:
  - Via points to be added or subtracted from spot rate [known as swap points]
  - Outright quotes
  - As an annualized percentage forward premium or discount 


### Annualised percentage
Formula for calculating the forward premium or discount for currency $j$ over $N$ period in American terms is 

$$f_{N,j} = \frac{f_{N}(\$ /j)-S(\$/j)}{S(\$/j)}$$

3-month forward premium or discount for the Japanese yen versus dollar.

Current: .00897
3-month forward: .00903

$$f_{N,j} = \frac{0.00903 - 0.00897}{0.00897} \times \frac{360}{91} = 0.0265$$
three-month forward premium is 0.0265 

### Forward point transaction
 forward rates might be displayed as:

- When the second known pair is smaller than the first, the dealer 'knows' the forward points are subtracted from the spot bid and ask price

### Over/under valuation:

| **Expected vs actual** | **Outcome** | **Reason** | Arbitrage profit
| --- | --- | --- | ---
Expected exchange rate (QC/BC) > actual exchange rate | - base currency is undervalued <br> - Quotation currency is over-valued | - You could be potentially earning more of the quotation currency given 1 unit of BC | - Buy the undervalued base currency <br> - Borrow/Sell the overvalued quotation currency 

### Triangular arbitrage
- Think of it in terms of the base currency. I.e., if the investment is in terms of $1M AUD, convert the cross rates to have an AUD base currency
  - Between the synthetic cross rate and the actual cross rate
- You will want to transact the most expensive cross rate first. Because the rates are in BC of the investment, you would multiple by the first investment, and divide by the second.
