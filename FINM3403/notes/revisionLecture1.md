### Spot market
The	spot market	involves almost	immediate purchase or sale of foreign exchange
 Quoted in direct or indirect terms
 - Direct: Home currency per unit of foreign currency (FC)AUD)
 - Indirect: Foreign currency (FC) per unit of Home currency

$S(j/k)$ will refere ot the price of one unit of currency $k$ in terms of currency $j$.

**Cross-exchange rate** is an exchange between a currency pair where neither currency is the U.S. dollar

### Bid-Ask spread
- Bid - the price in which the bank dealer will pay (buy) the currency for
- Ask - the price in which the bank dealer will sell the currency for

### Calculating the cross-exchange rate Bid-Ask spread
- use two direct or indirect quotes

$$S^{a}(\pounds / SFr) = S^{a}( \pounds / \$  ) \times S^{a}(\$/SFr)$$

- a direct bid is the reciprocal of an indirect ask
- a direct ask is the reciprocal of an indirect bid

### Forward market
- Contracting today for the furture pruchase or sale of foreign exchange
- $F_{N}(j/k)$, the price of one unit of currency 4k$ in terms of currency $j$ for delivery in $N$ months
- under certain conditions the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the expected spot exchange rate $N$ months into the future. 
  - Trading at a premium to the dollar in American terms, we can say the markets expect the US dollar to *depreciate* relative to the Swiss franc
  - When the dollar is trading at a *discount* to the Swiss franc, we can say the market expects the Swiss franc to appreciate, or become more valuable, relative to the dollar. It costs fewer francs to buy a dollar forward.

### Forward premium
- Express the premium or discount as an annualised percentage deviation from the spot rate

- There are three ways to express forward rates:
  - Via points to be added or subtracted from spot rate [known as swap points]
  - Outright quotes
  - As an annualized percentage forward premium or discount 


### Annualised percentage
Formula for calculating the forward premium or discount for currency $j$ over $N$ period in American terms is 

$$f_{N,j} = \frac{f_{N}(\$ /j)-S(\$/j)}{S(\$/j)}$$

3-month forward premium or discount for the Japanese yen versus dollar.

Current: .00897
3-month forward: .00903

$$f_{N,j} = \frac{0.00903 - 0.00897}{0.00897} \times \frac{360}{91} = 0.0265$$
three-month forward premium is 0.0265 

### Forward point transaction
 forward rates might be displayed as:

- When the second known pair is smaller than the first, the dealer 'knows' the forward points are subtracted from the spot bid and ask price
