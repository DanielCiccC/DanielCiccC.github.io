# Lecture 10: international diversification


### Why Invest Overseas?
- Security returns are much less correlated across countries than within a country.
  - This is so because economic, political, institutional, and even psychological factors affecting security returns tend to vary across countries, resulting in low correlations among international securities.
  - Business cycles are often highly asynchronous across countries.

> Higher the correlation, the greater the core movement
> - Correlations across markets are likely to be imperfect (i.e. less than one)
> - two stocks in the Aus market 
> - Different industries and industrial cycles, some countries in contractary phase whilst other are booming
>
> - Diversify to get benefits you would not normally get investing in one economy only
>   - Commodity prices, 

### Effects of exchange rates
- The realized dollar return for an Australian resident investing in a foreign market will depend not only on the return in the foreign market but also on the change in the exchange rate between the dollar and the foreign currency.

> Receiving US dollars, converted into local currency
> - Investment can be affected by exchange rate


### Foreign Exchange Returns
An illustration with an American stock
- An Australian investor takes AUD1,000,000 on 1/1/2016 and invests in Microsoft (MSFT) which trades on the NASDAQ
  - On 1/1/2016, the spot exchange rate was AUD 1.3765/USD
- The investor purchases 13,094 shares valued at $55.48 for a total investment of USD 726,460
- At the end of the 2022, the investor sells the shares at a price of $232.13 per share yielding AUD 4,753,339.59
  - On 29/12/2022, the spot exchange rate was AUD 1.5638/USD
- The investor receives a 375% return on investment (AUD 4,753,339.59/AUD1,000,000) -1 = 375%

> - On the day you liquidate US investment, USD appreciated
>   - converted US to AUD

- An illustration with Australian stock returns
  - The total return reflects not only the appreciation in the USD stock price but also the change in the USD (appreciation in this case)
- The formula for the total return is

**General Formula**
- The total return of the foreign investment reflects not only the 
appreciation of the foreign asset, but also the appreciation (or 
depreciation) of the foreign currency relative to the home 
currency.
- The formula for the total return is:

> Change in the movements plus the value of the underlying asset


### Foreign Returns and risk

> - Things in finance are extremely dynamic
> - Have to take into account currency return, and risk as well
>   - Markets at large, US market, Aus, etc.
>   - i.e. index fund has moved over a period of time
> - Same calculations on a market index, in regards to purchasing from a different market altogether
>
> MSCI index
> - Developed countries and developing countries, standard index
>
> Return of MSCI australian index
> - How has Aus dollar performed in US dollar terms
> 1. Average returns over a long window - yearly return, 1995 onwards
> 2. Monthly change, Aus dollar US dollar exchange rate
> 3. Aus/US dollar return
>
> This column, average Aus return in US was 9.15%
>
> **volatilities**
> - Use Standard deviation function in excel
> - Annualise it, take the monthly multiply by square root 12
> - Stdev of Aus returns in AUS is 13.59%
> - calculate standard deviation of exchange rate over that period, **Currency Return** 


### Adding up volatilities
- As shown in the previous slide, the volatility of currency returns 
affects the volatility of USD return on a foreign equity (last column). 
But volatilities of FC market returns & currency returns are not 
additive. Why?

![alt text](assets\IMG182.PNG)

$$cov(x, y) = \rho_{x,y} \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}$$


If correlation ($\rho$) = 1, the volatility of the dollar return is the sum 
of the foreign equity volatility and currency return volatility.

### Key results of portfolio theory
- The extent to which risk is reduced by portfolio diversification 
depends on the correlation of assets in the portfolio.
- As the number of assets increases, portfolio variance 
becomes more dependent on the covariances (or correlations) 
and less dependent on variances.
- The risk of an asset when held in a large portfolio depends on 
its return covariance (or correlation) with other assets in the 
portfolio.

> Measures of risks are not additive, have to take into account covariance
