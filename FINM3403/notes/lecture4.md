# Lecture 4: Foreign currency derivatives

### Derivatives:

- These are financial instruments whose value depends on an observable value
  - A financial asset, such as a stock price (or commodity or exchange rate), is used as an observable value. In such case, that asset is referred to as the underlying asset.
- Derivatives include:
  - Options: A contract that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to transact in an asset.
  - Futures: A contract to buy or sell a commodity at a point in the future. Changes in prices in the commodity are settled daily.
  - Swaps: A contract in which two parties exchange cashflows from different financial instruments.

- Derives its value from some underlying assets
- Commodities, financial assets, weather and currency derivatives etc.
- minimise the risk of home currency depreciating against foreign currency
- Swaps are typically long contracts (5-10 years)

### Futures and Forwards
Currency forward and futures contracts both represent an obligation to buy or sell a certain amount of a specified currency some time in the future at an exchange rate determined now.

- NOTE: futures contracts trade on organised exchanges

/- | **Futures contracts** | **Forwards Contract**
--- | --- | ---
Markets: | Prices determined in centralised exchanges | Decentralised interbank market
Trading Hours: | Most trading during exchange hours | Open somewhere around the world
| Contract size | Standardised sizes depending on currency | Standard size of $1m etc. and can be tailored
| Contract maturity | Fixed delivery dates: 3rd Wed. of March, June Sept or Dec. | Fixed maturities (1, 3, 6 or 12 months) or can be tailored to specifications
Quotation: | American terms (USD/FC) | American (USD/FC) or European (FC/USD)
| Settlement | Delivery of underlying fx is feasible, but almost never occurs. Position closed out by taking an offsetting position | Delivery of foreign exchange normally takes place
| Security against default | Clearning houses stand behind traders | Assets of bank
| Required collateral | Margin requirements ("Performance bond") | Deposit required if not standing relations with bank
| Cash flows | Occur daily because of "market-to-market" feature | No cash flows until forward contract matures


NOTES:
- Futures traded on CME group
- Future trade on a exchange and HAVE to be standardised.
- currency size for AUD is approx $125,000
- FC - foreign currency
- when you buy a futures contract, you have to open a margin account (collateral). They will tell you what the minimal amount in the margin
- In the case of a forward contract is unregulated - counterparty risk.
  - with future contracts, counterparty risk is 0. Dealing with the clearing house. Changes are reflected on a daily basis
- Forward contract: Deposit might be required if you have no standing relationship with the bank 
- Almost never take delivery of the future contract - just to hedge against moving price

- buyer of the contract of the upwards sloping line
- Temptation (if you are seller) if the price increases is very low. Contracts are rewritten every day
- 


### Options contracts

Options contracts give the option holder the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified amount of the underlying asset (currency; stock) at a pre-determined price (exercise or strike price).
