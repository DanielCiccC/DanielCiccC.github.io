## Balance of Payments - BOP
- The BOP is a statistical record of the flow of all of the payments between the residents of a country and the rest of the world in a given year.

- Any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered in the BOP accounts as a debit and is given a negative sign.
- Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered as a credit and given a positive sign.


Assuming change in official reserves and errors are approximately zero:

$$ \text{Current Account = (-) Financial Account}$$

This will hold approximately for floating rate countries.

### Current Account (CA)
Comprises of:
- Exports
- Imports
- Primary Income
  - payments of receipts, dividends and other income on foreign investments that were previously made
- secondary income - unilateral transfers
  - 'unrequited' payments, including foreign aid, reparations, official and private grants, etc.

> NOTE:
> 
> A country must finance its current account deficit either borrowing from foreigners or by drawing down on its previously accumulated foreign wealth, a current account deficit represents a reduction in the country’s net foreign wealth

### Capital Account
- Capital account includes capital transfers and disposals of nonfinancial assets between residents and foreigners.

$$ KA = \text{Capital Inflow (cr) – Capital outflow (dr)}$$

### Financial Account
- Balance difference between sales of assets to foreigners and purchases of foreign assets

Comprises of:
- Portfolio investment
- Direct investment 
  - (takeover or acquiring a substantial portion of a foreign company, i.e., ˃ 10%)
- Other Investment

> NOTE:
> 
> Sales of assets are recorded as credits, and result in *inflows* to the KA account. Purchases (imports) of foreign assets are recorded as debits and lead to *capital outflow*.


### Errors and Omissions
- Errors and Omissions - difference between CA balance, Capital Account and Financial Account
- Errors and omissions also used in valuations

### Official Reserve Assets
- Total reserves held by official monetary authorities within a country (RBA in Australia).
- These reserves are typically comprised of major currencies that are used in international trade and financial transactions, gold and reserve accounts (SDRs) held at the IMF.

> NOTE;
>
> The only way you can run a deficit if is someone is willing to fund it - funded by the central bank


### Linking CA to National Income

$$ Y = \text{National Income}$$

$$  C + I + G = \text{Domestic Residents Spending/Absorption}$$
Where:
$C$ - Consumption, $I$ - Investments, $G$ - Government spending

$$CA = \text{excess of spending over income earned (Income - spending)}$$

Therefore:
- CA Deficit → CA < 0 → Borrowing from Abroad to finance domestic spending
- CA Surplus → CA > 0 → Lending Abroad

$$ CA = \text{Savings - Investment} = \text{Net foreign investment}$$

- If a country’s income exceeds its spending, savings will exceed domestic investment, yielding surplus capital. 
- This surplus capital will be invested overseas and will be reflected as a financial account deficit for that country (more capital is flowing out of the country than into it).

> NOTE
> 
> - If Australia is running of CA surplus and its domestic residents are NOT acquiring foreign assets, then it must be that the RBA is acquiring foreign assets (i.e., there is a drawing down of the central bank’s reserve holdings)
> - If the BOP is negative, then ORT is positive with the RBA selling FOREX reserves and buying domestic currency.


CA and KA balances

**Credit (+)** | **Debit (-)** | **Account**
| --- | --- | ---
Export of goods and services | Import of goods and services | CA
Income received (dividends or interest) | Income paid | CA
Unilateral transfer received | Unilateral transfer paid | CA
Increasing domestic asset owned by foreigner | Decreasing domestic assets owned by foreigners  | KA
Decreasing foreign assets owned by home residents | Increasing foreign assets owned by home residents (giving out a loan, e.g.) | KA
Increase in liabilities (to foreign country) | Decrease in liabilities (to foreign country) | KA
