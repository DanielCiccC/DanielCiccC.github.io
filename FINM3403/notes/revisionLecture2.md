## Balance of Payments - BOP
- The BOP is a statistical record of the flow of all of the payments between the residents of a country and the rest of the world in a given year.

- Any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered in the BOP accounts as a debit and is given a negative sign.
- Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered as a credit and given a positive sign.


### Current Account (CA)

- Exports
- Imports
- Primary Income
  - payments of receipts, dividends and other income on foreign investments that were previously made
- secondary income - unilateral transfers
  - 'unrequited' payments, including foreign aid, reparations, official and private grants, etc.
