### Characteristics of FX Markets:
- Largest of all financial markets with average daily 
turnover of over $8.5 Trillion! Spot transactions - $2 
trillion; FX swaps dominate.
    - short term instrument, buy and within a week period
    - Banks use for liquidity
- 64% of all foreign exchange transactions involves cross-
border counterparties
    - counterparty, or pushed-out risk
- Only $\approx$ 6% of daily spot transactions involve non-financial customers.
- US dollar involved in one-side of 85% of all trades, a slight decline from the 2019 survey; Euro is at 31%.
- Australian $AUD is the 5th  most heavily traded currency
- Loosely organised in two tiers: wholesale & retail

### Characteristics of Wholesale markets
- Not an organized exchange
  - No fixed opening hours, centralized clearing mechanism, standardized contracts, etc.
  - No equivalent of a stock market or derivative market
- Extremely deep and liquid market
  - trade sizes 200-500M
- Participants in the market:
  - International banks
  - Bank customers engaged in commercial and Investment transactions, BHP, QIC, e.g. 
  - Non-bank dealers 
  - FX brokers
  - Central banks  
- Settlement of transactions – No real money changes hands
  - The role of SWIFT
  - Communication System
  - Society of Worldwide International Financial Telecommunications
    - Money often more through multiple banks before ending in the correct accounts

- chips, fedwire, target - organisations to transfer money


### Exchange rate

- A foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency.
- A foreign exchange quotation (or quote) is a statement of willingness to buy or sell at an announced rate. 
  - Market makers - foreign currency dealers and brokers
  - binding quotes for a few minutes


- normally quote to four digits
- normally settles T+2
- have all the contributors at the bottom, with their bid/ask


### Terminology
- Spot Rate: The exchange rate at which trades are executed immediately in the interbank market. About a third of all FX trading is done in this market.
- Value Date for a spot transaction is the date on which parties receive the funds they have purchased – e.g., in trades involving USD, settlement occurs two business days after the deal.
  - Foreign currency dealers provide two quotes: 
        - Bid Price: Price at which the dealer is willing to buy a currency from you (i.e., client)
        - Ask Price: Price at which the dealer is willing to sell a currency to you (i.e., client)
- It is always the case that the Ask Price > Bid Price. The difference is the Bid-Ask spread
- The less traded and more volatile a currency, the greater is the spread. 


### Bid/ask prices
$$\text{USDCHF} \; \; \; .8505-0.8507*$$
USD - base currency
CHF - Quote currency

$\text{USDCHF}_{bid} = 0.8505$ - the rate at which the bank woll buy USD (base currency) in exchange for CHF

$\text{USDCHF}_{ask} = 0.8507$ - the rate at which the bank will sell USD (base currency) for CHF

- In the wholesale market, for a currency pair, there is a 
base currency (the first currency in the pair), and quote currency (the second). This is what Bloomberg uses.
- Other quotations used in business include
  - **Direct Quote:** Home currency per unit of foreign currency (FC)
  - **Indirect Quote:** Foreign currency (FC) per unit of Home currency
  - American & European terms are direct and indirect quotes relative to the US dollar (USD). The quote in the previous slide is in European terms.

-  Note that in all cases, the reciprocal of a direct quote is an indirect quote and vice-versa.
-  

### Example, AUDCHF
$$\text{AUDCHF} \; \; \; .5699-0.5700*$$
AUD - Base currency
CHF - Quote currency
If AUD is local currency, this would be an indirect quote

- Cross-rate is an exchange rate that does NOT involve the 
USD
-  Explain the following quotes:
-  $\text{AUDCHF}_{bid} = 0.5699$ the amount of AUD the **bank** would buy from you in excahnge for 1 CHF
-  $\text{AUDCHF}_{ask} = 0.5700$ the amount of AUD the **bank** would sell to you in exchange for 1 CHF

- Bid and Ask prices mixed with alternative quotations methods can lead to confusion. Try to remember:
  - The dealer buys the denominator (or base) currency at the BID [client buys the numerator (or quote) currency at the bid]
  - The dealer sells the denominator (base) currency at the ASK [client sells the numerator (or quote) currency at the ask]
- When all else fails, remember that the commercial client always, ALWAYS gets the worse end of the deal

### Inverse exchange rate

- a direct bid is the reciprocal of an indirect ask
- a direct ask is the reciprocal of an indirect bid

# Bid-Ask spread
- The difference between the bid and ask prices is the bid-ask spread. It represents a “round-trip” transaction and is the cost of entering into the transaction.

$$\text{spread} = \frac{\text{Ask - Bid}}{\text{Ask}} \cdot 100$$
$$\text{spread} = \frac{\text{0.5700 - 0.5699}}{\text{0.5700}} \cdot 100$$
$$= 0.01754\% \; \; \text{or 1.75 basis points}$$

### Triangular arbitrage
-  Cross rates can be used to check on opportunities for intermarket arbitrage.  Suppose the following exchange rates are available:

- The synthetic (manufactured) cross rate between Euros and 
Canadian dollars is: 

$$\frac{Euro/U\$}{C/U\$} = EURO 1.5044/C\$$$

### Arbitrage example

### Forward contracts
- Forward transactions require delivery at a future date of a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of another currency.
- This is a rate that is agreed upon today but 
settled further into the future. 
- Forward contracts are traded on the inter-bank 
market. They can be tailored for
  - contract sizes
  - currency
  - delivery dates 


### Ways to quote forward rates
- There are three ways to express forward rates:
  - Via points to be added or subtracted from spot rate [known as swap points]
  - Outright quotes
  - As an annualized percentage forward premium or discount 

### Forward quotes: Swap rates
- Among themselves, foreign exchange traders 
usually quote forward rates in terms of points, 
also referred to as “forward points” or “swap 
rates” (see previous slide).
- A point (pip) is the last digit of a quotation
  - A point (pip) is equal to 0.0001 (1/100 th of 1%) for most currencies.
  - The Japanese yen is the exception. It is quoted only to two decimal places; A point, in this case, is 1/100.

- If F > S then the currency in the denominator (base currency) is trading at a premium
  - E.g. One AUD buys more USD in the forward market than the in the spot market 
  - If ascending between bid/offer forward points then forward price will be higher than the current spot price
- If F < S then the currency in the denominator (base currency) is trading at a discount*
  - E.g. One AUD buys less USD in the forward market than the in the spot market
  - If descending between bid/offer forward points then forward price will be lower than the current spot price
  - If F = S then market is relatively flat

 When the Bid Points > Ask Points, you subtract the points from the spot rate to get the outright forward quote:

### Forward premium/Discount
- Forward premium (discount) exists when a currency purchases more (less) of the 2nd currency in the future than it does presently.

### % change in exchange rates
 The Australian dollar was quoted at CHF 
0.9489/AUD in January 2013, while in January 
2024, it was quoted at CHF 0.5701/AUD*

- At t-1 (Jan 2013): CHF 0.9489/AUD
- At t    (Jan 2024): CHF 0.5701/AUD.

Thus, the appreciation/depreciation of the $, 
relative to the CHF from t-1 to t is:
