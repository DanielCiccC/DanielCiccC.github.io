<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A tax scheme is tax neutral if it meets three criteria:

<li dir="auto">Capital import neutrality (exclusion method): the tax burden on an MNC subsidiary should be the  same regardless of where in the world the MNC in incorporated.</li>
<li dir="auto">Capital export neutrality (credit method): the tax scheme does not incentivize citizens to move their money abroad.</li>
<li dir="auto">National neutrality: taxable income is taxed in the same manner by the taxpayer’s national tax authorities regardless of where in the world it is earned.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Capital export neutrality:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The corporate tax rate is 30 percent. The corporate income tax rate
applies to both resident and non-resident companies.
A resident company is liable to corporate income tax on its worldwide
income and capital gains. A non-resident company is liable to corporate
income tax on its Australian-source income only, and on capital gains
from the disposal of an asset that is taxable Australian real property
(TARP). Broadly, TARP will include Australian real property and certain
indirect interests in Australian real property.
The Australian tax system provides taxation relief against international
double taxation by granting foreign tax offsets in some circumstances
and in others, by exempting the foreign income from Australian tax. The
corporate income tax rate applies to income earned during the period
from 1 July to 30 June of the following year.</li>
