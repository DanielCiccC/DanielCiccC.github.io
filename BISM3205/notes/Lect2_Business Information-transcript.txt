What did you do? What is it? I have emailed you this for the afternoon. If you had access to your mhm why All right,

SPEAKER 1
guys, let's get started. Welcome back to week number two of our exciting topic. Cybersecurity. Before we start, I have a guest speaker here who is making an announcement related to the business school. So it's got nothing to do with this course. I was just asked to make five minutes available of my lecture to, uh, an announcement that, uh, will, um, apply to all students in, uh, in this class. So we're just finding the right slide, and you have to quit my PowerPoint. Otherwise, it doesn't get displayed up here, So you go to power points. So Yep. All right, over to you. Thank you so much with this weekend.

SPEAKER 0
Provo. Uh, hey, how are you? Um, I wanted to say that you might take my class in the coming semester, but I realised one of my previous student is here. Uh, And you, uh, I. I thought my course is the last course. So some of my students are here, which is really good. My name is Morteza, and I'm a senior lecturer in machine learning and LA Natural Language Processing. So I teach machine learning. And also my research is, uh, N LP and recently LLM that I do with and you Oh, the legend. So I don't need to talk. Well, you can ask the the rest of the student what we are doing. Basically, uh, we are running a hackathon, which is going to basically the process is going to start from next week. And basically, the final day is 29th of August. Who knows What is hackathon? Who knows? OK, you guys should know. I have talked about it. So basically, uh, with hackathon, we have, uh the title is tech for change. Basically, we want to motivate our students to basically think about the problem that really matter. For for everyone is for social good and to think how they can leverage their learning their knowledge to address something for social good. So the event is like that that you work in in a group, uh, with some student that, you know, you can shape a team yourself or we can help you to find some team members, and then you work on a problem you present it, you get some feedback and then you have a chance to win. So that's the whole concept. So, uh, because we thought you are a business student, some of you would like to work with data. Some of you are not really in that stage that you want to do. Actual data analysis, model building. You might want to work on a strategy. So we designed two strategies for those who are more technical. You want to do more model building or analysis dashboarding. You can work on data stream. Or if you want to work on a strategy side, you can basically qualitatively uh, go, for example, through some government reports, some numbers and come with some solutions, some suggestions or some areas of limitation. We will work with you, but in both extremes, Uh, two. Help you and mentor you to basically improve your work. During this process, you gain some experience of working. Hello. On working on real world problem and working with the mentors on strategy stream, you will get the guidance from Associate Professor Stan. I still cannot pronounce Stan surname. Well, yes, something like that. So But his name is for sure. First name is Stan. So, uh, and also Katie. William, Uh, they will mentor you. And, uh, you know James James Boyce. The theatre and me will work with those who want to go, uh, work on data Analytical Stream mainly. So I talked about the strategy stream and also data driven stream or technical stream. The choice of a problem, I think is with you. You if you have something that is interesting for you, let's say, uh, global warming, poverty, diversity, anything for social good. You can work on that problem. You can choose the problem, work with team member on that problem. Or we can also help you to find the data set or a problem to work on. Um, what will happen? Basically, during this process, we will kick off from next Monday. We will have information session on Monday. I will provide the detail. Then by the end of next week, you should have your team, and then you have 2 to 3 weeks to work on the problem. And we will have a final day on the final day, which is 29th. We will have panel, uh, from, uh, people will come from government from industry. Some from university students also will sit and will listen to your presentation. Basically, you can, uh, showcase what you have done. And there would be chance for winning the prize. We have two different streams. So if you work on a strategy problem, then you will compete with those strategy people teams. And if you work on data driven, uh, problem, then you will compete with them. We will have, uh, in total, uh, 4 to 6 prices and you will have basically, uh, the certificate for the competition or if you win the award. So I think, uh, it's it's a good opportunity for you guys to have the experience of working, uh, on a real world problem, get the feedback from the expert and have the chance to win it. And it would be helpful for you in your job application, and hopefully there would be opportunities for internship and basically job application. So if you are interested just as Candice barcode, um, put your detail there Even if you don't do that, the details for the information SES session is there next Monday, 5 p.m. and the venue is there. Hopefully we will see many of you over there. Thank you. Thank you so much.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you. I will put these slides up on blackboard tonight. Thank you. Yeah. All right. Today's lecture is divided into two parts. The first part is the need for security. And the second part is the legal, ethical and professional issues. Now, if you happen to work with the textbook, you can find that in chapter two and three. But as I said last week, we don't go by the textbooks. These chapter numbers are there just for reference, in case you wanted to read up more in the textbook. If you happen to have that, uh, if you have all your laptops ready, I'd like you to go to Blackboard now. And you will find, uh, under learning resources a URL that's labelled bank. So if you wouldn't mind going to this right now, it looks like this. So you've been asked there to enter some user name and password. Please do not enter any valid password that you have somewhere else in your bank or UQ account or something else. Just type in some rubbish password. I'll explain later, so try to log into our bank. Oh, it's not there. I have to remember to exit my PowerPoint every time I go to the Internet. Otherwise it doesn't show up. There you go. This is what it should look like on your screens. How are we going with this on blackboard? There's a URL called Bank. You click on that and you come to this page. Yes. Some people have clicked on this and entered some login details. So once you've done this, you will find a message there at the bottom. So what I've demonstrating here is used by hackers, and it's called a click jacking attack. So it's not hijacking, but click jacking. So I'm hijacking the clicks you're making on a web page. So how does this work? Well, if you go to the real bank All right, let's take this into a paste buffer and then we're pasting this back here. Now that's the same URL, right. However, see here when I pasted this, the browser is very clever. It's actually replacing that with some other code that used to be an A right. That's the A here. Now that's not an A from my American English keyboard that is an A from a different alphabet from the acrylic alphabet. So it looks like our English A. But it's not the same code computer wise, it's coming from a different alphabet. So for the human, it looks exactly the same. But for the computer, it's a different URL. B A is different. So if you go to the real website, which is this one here. So I just replace the A with an A from my keyboard you will get the same looking website which is the real website. So I'm typing in here. My user name and my password submit and nothing happens. So theoretically, I'm now logged in, right? But if I do this over here right there is what I just typed in. So there's a clear difference, right? But you can't see this because the L looks the same to you. So what is going on under the hood here? How does it all work? So let's have a look at the code. Yeah, Web page. So that's what I was looking for. Sorry. So here is the page sauce for this, um, malicious website. So this is the end result. But if we go back to the website before, which is containing the malicious court. So this is the malicious code now. OK, so this is the hackers website that looks like the bank website. So there's some HTML command in here, So HTML is just hypertext markup language in case you're familiar with this. Um, but the browser will receive all this stuff right, And it will turn it into a nice looking Web page. So that's the task of a browser taking HTML code that comes from some Web server and turning into a nice looking Web page. It's got all the instructions there where to put the text, where to put the colours in the pictures. So it's called HTML so we can look at the the code that comes down the line into our browser and you can see here There's a statement iframe source bank dot HTML. So this is the real bank website that we saw, um, over here, right. That's the real bank website with the A in English. Now, what I'm doing here is I'm pretending I'm showing this website in an iframe. So an iframe is something that lets you include another web page into your old Web page so that's used for YouTube videos. When you embed a YouTube video in your website, you're using an iframe command in your HTML, so I'm embedding the normal website into my website. But what I do is on top of that, I create a form replacing the input fields of the real website with my own input fields and the rest of the website is totally transparent. So the real bank website is shining through underneath. But I'm putting two form fields on top that are exactly positioned where the real bank websites form fields are. And then I'm typing my user name password into the hackers website, the transparent page on top, and then it will run a script called hacker dot PHP form action. So if I press enter, this code here is run. So what does this code do? There it is. So let's put this into a open with notepad. So let's have a look at what this hacker code does. So this is a script that runs on the server, not in the browser, right, And in there I'm getting the user name password from a post request. After I've pressed, enter on the form. This will run and it gets the user name password into some variables here from the form. And then I'm displaying the message with performing maintenance. I could also go now to the real bank website and user would have to log in again. And then I'm displaying the message here. Here's your user name. Here's your password, but I got from the from the form and then I am populating text file called PW dot text with the user name and password. There's a user name password. It's put into content, and content is put into this file. So now let's have a look at this fire, see what's in there. So here is the real websites, right? So now, instead of bank dot HTML, you can do that on your machines. It type PW dot text. Right. So this is the text file that I'm populating with user name passwords that have been put in by you guys. So this is all the user name and passwords now. So I've now harvested everybody's user name password, and that's why I said to you, don't put real passwords there because that is now available on the Internet for everybody to see the You see yourself there somewhere. That's how easy it is. And that's called click Checking. So there's our fake website with the A and Cry. And there's our text F, all the user name passwords, and we have inspected the source code and we learned how to do this. And here is another picture about, you know, the real bank website. And then my transparent page overlaid the hackers Web page with just those two form fields visible. And that's where you type in your user name password, not in the bank website underneath. And then I can harvest that because I'm in charge of the script creating this, I can harvest that and put it into a file. Right. So some. And this is a YouTube video that shows you how to use the iframe command. So that's a normal YouTube video here. Uh, I have to exit my session again. Right. So that's a normal YouTube video. You go to YouTube and you play this video is fantasy. Got it. All right. So now if we embed this YouTube video in another page to show you how that's done Mm. So here we have a page that says Iframe. So this is WWW dot schools. Right? So this is a little website where people can play around and and test things out in HTML on the left hand side, and that result is displayed on the right hand side. So here the i frame is used, and here the YouTube video that I just showed you is embedded in this web page over here. So that's right around. I could put text there if I wanted to. And then the YouTube video is playing inside. OK, so that's how an I frame works, and that's the normal use of an IRA. So what I can do is I can actually test a website whether it has, um, something embedded in it that makes it impossible to put itself into an IRA. So here is the, uh the website that lets us test. This was publicly available website dot signal.com. So here we can input a a website. Uh, let's say facebook.com Do they have any preventative measures implemented in Facebook.com website that allows that this allows a hacker from embedding the Facebook website into their website so they can harvest credentials, Do they have that? Yes or no? This will not tell us. Yes. T. There is a bit of code in there called the X Frame Options header in this web page and it's passing the test so I can't put a facebook.com website in an IRA in my own website. It will just not appear in there. It will just be blank because of this thing here. Now, if I go to Yeah, um anz bank.com dot a U that's a normal a NZ bank. Right? And it also has that however, if I go to this part of the ANZ website, which really should have that, which is the login page four a NZ. That's the important one. When you log in log in anz.com Internet banking, it hasn't got that right. So the important bit of login page hasn't got that protection. So I can import that into an IRA in my own Web page, and theoretically I could harvest credentials. There might have some other things in there that protects us. Of course, it wouldn't be that easy, but it's just an example for you to see how the X frame options test can prevent at least this particular attack. All right, back to my PowerPoint. Yes. So these are the two, URL S that I just used to test this out. So this is an explanation of how I tricked you to go to this hacker website. I just replaced the A. So that was actually first done in 2005 people have put, uh, paypal.com. I put the acrylic a in there, and then it goes to, uh, a website Mhm that tells you that you probably went to the wrong website. So you have misspelt paypal.com you can see up here. It doesn't actually say paypal.com anymore, because it's got that acrylic a in there that the one I used. So the browser is cleverly saying to you, Well, that is actually not an a right. That's something else. So it displays the URL in what is called puny code. You can google that as a, um a, um, Wikipedia page on this and how this all works. But see, the A is missing there. And then they put hyphen something after, which means well, the A has been replaced with something else. So there's some special code that tells you what happened there. So look at the URL to make sure that you actually go into PayPal. So this is not paypal. You know, there's the browser. Tells me you have probably done something wrong, so go back and fix it up. So if I go to the real pay PayPal, pay how? As to why Paypal.com Website? No. What did the wrong Now I've got this in front of it now. The PICO stuff. There you go. There's a real pay website. OK, so that was actually first done in 2005, and people fell for this. They put their logins into paypal, and then people took over the account and so on. So it's called a homo glyph attack. So we had two different attacks here, right? The first one was, um, using the, um, click checking using a website that takes your click away. And then how did you get to this website With a homo glyph attack? By changing letters into letters from a different alphabet. You go to this website here and it will display to us Let me exit my PowerPoint again. It displays nicely how you can create similarly looking letters so that takes the search away from you. If you're a hacker, what letter could I use for this letter to make a different URL? So if I enter my last name here, it gives me a great number of options. So all these letters here look like a PAU AD. So if I want to change the P, I can take this P here and then down here, it will look like that. So there's a big space there, so that's too obvious. So that's not what I want. I want this to look as a capital. I don't want that. There's a capital again. Looks better. No space or there. So this looks good. So this is a different alphabet. The P looks pretty much like our P. So I can now register a URL under this name, right? And if you trick people to go to that looks the same. Then they end up on my website not on the real Pinsky website, and therefore I can do whatever I want with them. Yeah, fascinating, isn't it? Did anybody know all this? No. Cool. Learning something new. All right. So where were we? Right. We finished with this, uh, puny code is just, uh, the URL to Wikipedia To explain how this is now translated into something that you can see There's something wrong with your URL. All right, back to business when security needs business needs, Uh, when security needs and business needs collide in an organisation, business needs always win. So that means if you know, somebody says we have to have that very secure implemented. But you know, there is a business need where we can't have that. For some reason, then the business will trump the security. Because the reason being, if you haven't got the business working properly, it doesn't matter what security you have. You're not making any money anymore, right? So you can have security implemented. But the business underneath is not functioning properly. Therefore, no money and you're bankrupt. So the business has to work first, and then security comes on top. That's what essentially this says it protects the ability to function, and, uh, it safeguards the technology assets and use. So data has to be protected in rest in transmission and also when it's being used. So storage, database, transmission, computer network, and when it's used in the CPU when it's being worked on. So we have to We have to protect the data at these different spaces. Now, if you later as business people work in the organisation, we have it people looking after all that. But you are managing the IT people, right? And you have to know about legislation and you have to tell the I it people well, there is a new legislation. You got to be on top of all this and therefore we have to now do this in it. Please implement that example. European Union has made a law that says if you send people to a website and to track them with cookies, you got to tell people that you're using cookies and you got to give the user an option to opt out of the cookies so they can't be tracked with cookies. You know, they can be tracked with other things, but that is something that you have to be aware of because if you don't implement this and it becomes low, then you're liable. So that's why we all have to now suffer from all these websites that asking us constantly we have cookies. Do you want to accept the cookies. Do you want the cookies Only for functional use or all the tracking cookies? Yes or no. And different people have different ways of asking you this questions and becomes really, really annoying. And you ask yourself, Well, this is a European law. Why do we in Australia have to suffer from all this? Well, the international websites and said Well, to avoid confusion, we have it all the same for everybody. So people in Australia also get this message even though we have got this law so that was implemented in 25 May 2018. Since then, we have to answer the cookie thing. And the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR has made made this law in Europe. Right? So you have to be on top of that and tell the it people that so got it have now implemented. So, as I said before, security has to be implemented. Uh, when you store process and transmit information. So I've got some three funny pictures here. You can remember this better. Uh, and, um, we have now some definitions of different buzzwords that we use in cybersecurity, and you should be familiar with them, and we're going through them right now. So here's a big list of different threads. Malware. Malware is something you put on your computer, uh, without knowing by clicking somewhere, downloading something. And then it does something bad fishing. We know already. That is an email that you click on and it asks you to log in somewhere similar to the bank website. And, uh, you inadvertently disclose private information like user name passwords or bank account details. Stuff like that Spear phishing is a special, um, targeted fishing attack. It's with a spear. So we're actually targeting a particular person in the organisation That's normally a person higher up in the organisation because they have lots of power. So their user name and password are worth goals, because if you log in with their user name and password, you can do almost anything in the company. So that's spear pushing, targeting a particular individual, the CEO or somebody like that man in the middle attack. So if you have a person here going to a website over here and you communicate with this website, there was there was a flaw in the iPhone. The SSL, uh, secure socket layer of vulnerability, and an attacker could actually pretend that they are the end website. And listen to this conversation and, uh, you know, play the man in the middle between those two and, you know, listen to everything that was going on, including user name passwords, denial of service attack. So that's the the D OS attack or also the DD OS attack denial of service. So it's got nothing to do with the disc operating system on on Windows computers. Uh, you bombard a website with lots of requests. So now the website is unable to, um, fulfil its normal duties again to, you know, make the website available to normal users because it's busy handling all these bogus requests. So that's AD OS attack AD D OS Attack is You do that distribution. So you have a hacker who's infiltrated. Let's say lots of IO websites. That's IOT devices in the world. You know, the, um, Alexa. Or, you know, the the temperature sensor in the goldfish tank or something like that. Right? So they've put malware into these and everything is fine. Everything works, But then they have a control, command and control centre that is connected to all these Iot devices and they have control of that and they press a button on that. And now the command and Control Centre is sending a command to all these IO devices that have now become slaves to do something. And they sent D OS attacks to this one particular targeted website. So you get thousands of different IO devices all hammering on that poor little website, and then it's also unable to respond to normal requests again. So that's AD dos attack distributed SQL injection. We'll talk about this in a later lecture. So this is when you, uh, attack the database directly. SQL structure to language is used to communicate with the database and you do something to get into the database. We talk about it later, zero day exploit. So some some hack that hasn't been made public yet some vulnerability in IOS or windows or whatever that has been found out. But nobody knows about it yet, So somebody has found oh, actually actually break into the system doing this and this right, But now nobody knows this. So that's a zero day attack. Zero days. This happened right now, Now, some people in the government, the FB, they harvest these things. They don't tell anybody they find out right. They put it in the drawer because now they have a tool to break into people's computers that they want to infiltrate for their criminals or whatever paedophiles and whatever and they want to get into their computers. So now they have a tool available, a zero day attack that they can use normally. When a person finds this, it's a white hat hacker, not a black hat hacker. So it's a good hacker. So White Hat hacker finds the vulnerability that I go to the company and say, Hey, Microsoft or Apple I found something in the operating system and you can actually do this and you break into all these computers. Please fix this within one month after one month, I will make this public and then it can be exploited. Hackers can use it, so now they have to fix it quickly. So you give them a grace period so they're forced to fix it, and then a new version comes out that you would have to install and then it's fixed. So that's why it's always important to install upgrades, updates to your software all the time because these zero days come along and have to be fixed and then your system is vulnerable all of a sudden. But with the fix, it's patched again. Advanced, persistent threats. So this is something if you target somebody for days, weeks, months, even years, one particular person like Bill Gates, because he's really important. So I have to get at Bill Gates no matter what. I'm not interested in Microsoft's other employees. Just Bill Gates. So therefore, I target this person, and that's normally done by hackers of countries that have the resources and manpower and money to do this. To have people working on this to hack this one person because that's important for their country to, you know, do an advanced, persistent threat. Ransomware is something that you inadvertently download on your computer. You press some button, you download something. All of a sudden, all your files are encrypted. You can't get at them anymore. Everything is encrypted. That's gobbledygook. Nothing works. So you get a big message on your screen that says, you know, um, please pay us Bitcoin such and such to this big number and Once you've done that, click here and then it will magically all be decrypted again. And this is for normal people. You know, they ask for $300 or something like this, and they say, Well, yeah, I'll pay $300 to get everything back because I haven't done a backup and, you know, and, uh, it's very inconvenient to have my computer turned into a pumpkin. So therefore, I'll just pay the $300 and I do this with thousands and millions of people, so they get, you know, a large amount of money. So if companies, uh, get targeted like that, uh, the government asked them not to pay because you're making the Attackers richer and they have more resources now because we've got all this additional money and also it proves that it works. So why don't we do it again, Right, So you're fostering this so the government tells people not to pay any ransomware tax to stop this, because if nobody ever pays anything, then you know they can win. The tax won't work right. They encrypt everything and not get any money back. So what's the point? You have to do something else. So Ransomware and the last one is DNS attack. This is a video on blackboard that explains what DNS is domain name server. So these are computers on the Internet that turn, you know, apple.com or uq.a.au. All these names that are easily to a member for humans that turn them into numbers. And these numbers are called IP addresses. So each computer in the world has got a unique IP address, right? And then when you type in, you want to go to uq.edu dot a U There's a domain name server that your computer will ask you. Actually, what IP is this and the domain name server will go back and say, Well, this is your 165 dot da da da da and then the browser will go to that. So you have to translate that. And that's done with DNS domain name service. Now you can poison this domain name servers and can say, Well, if somebody ask for UQ instead of giving them the real IP address, give them this IP address, which is my hacker site. Right? So you actually get directed to the wrong side now what computers do is they don't always go to the domain name server. Once they've got the IP address, it's unlikely to change, right. They store that in the file on your on your hard drive. So then next time they look at the file and then they go to that IP address. So in your file, it's called Hosts the Hosts file and Windows. It will have IP address, or it will have the domain name and the IP address. It will be file the text file so the computer will go in there and say, Oh, there they go there, Finish. You don't have to ask the domain name server, but hackers can now because it's on your C drive. Change that file right so they can go and replace the appears with a different one and bang, you end up in the wrong on one computer. So these are DNS attacks. Right now comes a couple of slides explaining terminology. What is an attack? What is an exploit and so on so quickly? Go through these because you have to be familiar with this. So an attack is an intentional or unintentional act that can damage or otherwise compromise information and or the system that supports it. So attack on your hardware software exploit is a technique used to compromise the system. We also speak of an attack vector. An attack vector is a phishing email, for example. So how do they get at you? That's an exploit. The vulnerability is a potential weakness in an asset. So asset like laptop, mainframe, computer router, all these assets, computer assets. So it's a weakness in this asset or in the defensive control of a system. Now, you as a business person, you have to know about these vulnerabilities. So what is out there? What what are the current ways of attacking me? My company? My assets? What are the threats and what? Where are my assets? What do I have to protect? So in the middle of this Venn diagram are the risks and you have to evaluate how much risk exposure do I have. And then, depending on how big this risk is, you implement countermeasures right and the countermeasures have to be in balance with the risk. Remember the bicycle with all these thousands of locks. If it's too locked up, they can't use it anymore. So you have to have a balance between the risk and the countermeasures. So what are threats? There's different threats out there, so deviation in quality of service. So we have some service in the company. You're providing some service to our customers, and that's not the same anymore. The quality of the service is diminished because of, you know, some sort of threat. Um, they could even attack your your rubbish collection or your waste water. Or, you know, the telephone system or something like that, and your operations are disrupted, right? No matter how so. The attacker doesn't necessarily have to go to a particular computer system in the company, but there's lots of threats out there that you can put on to a company to make them work, you know, harder, heavier. It's like walking through honey, right, because you know, the trash is building up on the outside. People don't like to come to us anymore. And, you know, you can demolish the business in many different ways, deviations in quality of service in any way possible power irregularities in the rural areas in Queensland, the power fluctuates a lot, right, so you would have to have a AUPS or or a power conditioner, Uh, before the power goes into your computer so the computer doesn't fry if the power of a sudden goes above 240 volts, number two, espionage or trespass. So this is called shoulder surfing. You know, somebody walks, you know, behind somebody working on the computer, and you don't see who's what's going on behind you. You're just involved in your your Excel spreadsheet or you're logging into the mainframe and somebody goes past and looks over your shoulder and say, Ah, well, he's typing this password. So now I know the password. Um, lots of people do this, Uh, hackers do this. They they pretend they are workmen, right? They have a little toolbox. They have an orange vest. Um, you know, boots with steel caps or whatever. They look like real workmen, but they don't touch the screwdriver or anything. They are hackers, right? So they're going around the office because everybody said, Oh, that's a worker there. They're fixing something. It happens all the time, right? So they don't question this person. So this person's got free rein now in the company to do whatever they want. So you have to implement procedures. New business people. You are in charge of procedures. You implement procedures. If somebody comes like that and wants to fix something, report to reception. Reception doesn't let them go in. Report to reception. Fill out the form. Right. Where are you? Who do you want to see? I want to see Alex in it. OK, I will call Alex. Now he will pick you up from reception, right? And then I come and say, Well, you're fixing the the leak in the window. Come with me. I'll show you where it is. And here's the leak. And then people will watch him fix the window and guide him back to reception, and then he can sign out and leave, so he's constantly monitored. So the weakest point in the organisation is not the fireballs and the other, um, passwords and all this. The weakest point is the people. The people want to be friendly, right? You come back from your lunch break and all these people smoke go outside where they all come back in and they open the swipe card, they open the door, they come in and hold the door open for you. And I just came in from the street and mixed with all the people there pretending I'm one of them. Big company. Nobody knows near each other. So and then now they're holding the door open for me. I can go in now and I'm the hacker. I just mixed in with those people outside in the lunch break and they're holding the door open for me. I don't need a swipe card. They open the door for me, People are the weakest point. So you have to have procedures in there. You might have two doors that you have to go through the one door and this has to close and the next one has to open or something like that or you ask everybody. Train people do not let them in. You close the door and says, You use your swipe card, right? You do it yourself. So that's how you can prevent espionage and trespass. So this is done at companies like ASIO right where security is is really high cameras with face recognition. This person we don't have that in our database door stays shut Forces of nature. Um near fire flooding is also a threat. Human error or failure, inexperience, improper training. Incorrect assumption can all lead to failure. And there are threat can cost money. Now, I think last week I told you about the I went to I've got Toyota car. I went to, uh, get the service at Toyota and I found outside. I found the picture again. Um, and I put it into the slides here. This is the outside of the Toyota service station. So you're in the driveway, essentially on the left hand side. There's a door. You go into reception. So outside is this computer, uh, PC computer. And then there's a walkie talkie on the left hand side and some numbers. So this is for the person When he, uh, gets the cars, there's lots of people coming with their cars to log them in, uh, and then park the car over there, and then they get serviced, right? But there is nobody, and you can see the yellow sticker there. Well, that's the user name password for this computer. And I saw the same at my doctor's right. There was an EKG station with a computer where the software was loaded on, and then the bed with all the wires to get the EKG done. And there was a yellow sticker exactly like that on top of the screen with the user name password in the doctor's practise. Right? So it's a bit more secure. But, I mean, the doctor walks out and I can just go and log in right quickly. Look at other people's phone number, address name, uh, maybe date of birth. They would have that for sure in the doctor's practise. And what do I need to call up? Origin and, uh, and cancel my account. Well, what's your name? Alex. What's your date of birth? Where do you live? My address. Right. And then I am Alex. No matter who says this. So anybody with this information can pretend to be you and cancel your your electricity or you transfer some money or something like that. So these things are really your password, your identity, name, phone number, date of birth and address. Most people use three or four of these things as identification. If you ring somebody up, nobody's got counters anymore. Everybody is on the phone these days. Too busy. So we just need that. And then you are you. So if I give you this, but me, you can ring up and you can pretend to me and everything will happen. As if I would say that dangerous. So do not fill out forms are necessary. Like to get your voucher or whatever. You get $5 off. If you buy $100 worth of goods and have a big form and you sign, you put everything in there that they ask you to sign. All your ID now is in this form you give it to anybody in this company can ring up and pretend to be you. So just to get $5 off, don't you know, give them your identity. Now, this guy here, um, Kevin Mitnick. He is a well known hacker, so I just want to show you this video. Um, this video is really great. It is a bit long, but if you can please watch it, it's really, really interesting. Now, this course is a two unit course, right? Each unit is five hours. So if you have two units in a course, that's 10 hours. If you have four courses with full time load at uni four courses, that's a 40 hour week. Right? So that's a normal working week, 40 hours a week. So, essentially, for this course, you have 10 hours available. You spend two hours in here and one hour tutorial. So that's three hours. You got seven hours left. People have asked me, um, in the schools, um, you say anything that you have to read to prepare for the next lecture I want to be, You know, I want to get a seven in schools. I want to really be good. And do you know a lot of reading and learning? So what can I do? We have seven hours, right? What do we do in these seven hours every week for the schools? This is I haven't got a, you know, great big textbook that you have to digest or other lecture slides. You can look at the video again. That's on blackboard of the lecture. The slides will come up, uh, on blackboards, but what else is there? Well, I'm giving you lots of links here in the slides. Follow these links. Look at this video, for example, which could for 25 minutes and follow Kevin met Nick's life. Right? And in there he will this woman will tell you about Kevin and how he became a hacker when he was near a couple of years old? Only say goodbye to old, costly cable TV. That's an ad. Let's wait until it's finished.

SPEAKER 2
Kevin Mitnick hacked into the largest tech companies on the planet. I've successfully compromised all systems that I targeted for unauthorised

SPEAKER 3
access except for one his Right.

SPEAKER 1
So this is Kevin in his younger days. He died last year from cancer, but he was the best hacker in the world at this stage when he was alive. And I go to 22 where he's actually talking about something important. So later he finally got caught after many, many years and lots of tricks that he availed the FBI all the time. This is America, right? Um, and finally got caught and he spent some time in jail. But when he came out, he was converted. He actually helped the FBI to catch hackers because he knew everything, right? So the FBI was very keen to get him on their side. And this is a court trial. Um, and this is what he said there when he

SPEAKER 2
was released on January 21st 2000, he said. My case is a case of curiosity. Thank you for being with us here today. After his release, his former adversary, the US government, invited him to share his insights.

SPEAKER 3
The human side of computer security is easily exploited and constantly overlooked. Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption and secure access devices, and it's money wasted because none of these measures address the weakest link in the secure already changed the people who use, administer, operate and account for computer systems that contain protected information. Kevin became hugely sought after Kevin, right?

SPEAKER 1
So the union is the biggest link in the company. You can have all the firewalls you want. You just ring up somebody and you're very confident in everything and they'll tell you everything you want to know. So have a look at this video. Very interesting. His whole life is, uh, displayed there. Kevin met Nick. Alright, so that's called social engineering. The skill to convince people to reveal secret information. So you just you pretend you you're the good guy, right? You ring up and you have an English accent and you're very polite and friendly and the old lady that you ring up will trust you. And, uh, OK, we have a anomaly in in your bank account. We want to fix this for you. Uh, just quickly give us your login details, and, uh, we can we can fix it for you. And then the old lady, you know, trust this person because he's so polite and he speaks with an English accent. So he must be, you know, for real. And, uh, she gets conned out of millions of dollars. Her whole life savings. This happens a lot of times. There are some figures later on the slides. Um, fishing. We know what that is. Advance fee fraud. So people say, Well, do you want a million dollars here, Give us $100 in this account so that we can release the funds to you. There's an administrative fee, right? So they a million dollars, I give you $100 to get a million dollars. No problem. But then it stops. You don't hear from them back. Ever. Certainly don't get a million dollars, but your $100 are gone, for sure. Fishing example. Yeah, we know all this already. Uh, because of covid Everybody worked from home and at home you don't have the cyber security anymore that you would have in the office. So a lot of people got targeted working from home. So cyber crime went up by 600% in covid times because people are vulnerable at home and per day, people received 18 million covid related phishing emails like this one here. So covid is finished now. But, you know, that was a big dent in people's, um, my, uh, bank accounts. All right, here's a figure that I wanted to give to you. This slides I copied from a previous person who gave the lecture. But, uh, I've updated the figure here. In 2024 9.5 trillion American dollars had to be paid by people around the world for cybercrime. So people got conned and in total, in the whole world. In 2024 9.5 trillion, not million trillion. See the number of zeros there, 12 zeros, 12 zeros. You can't actually imagine how much that money that is. You could never be spending this yourself. So that is an enormous amount of money and a dent in the economy because people don't have this money anymore, so they can't spend it to buy stuff. Right? So the economy in the country suffers from that as well, not just the person themselves. Here are some three cases that these three links go to these three websites describing these cases again Something to look at in your seven hours every week. Germany, a train station. You know how we have the displays and train station. Next train is coming at five o'clock. This this, uh, track and so on. So this is display in Germany, obviously a window system producing that. And there's the message on top. All your files have been encrypted pay. So so many Bitcoins to this address that that little window there on top is saying that that happened in 2005 and 2015 in Germany. Then there was in America all these hospitals that belong together they got hacked so people couldn't even do an X Ray anymore right in all these hospitals because the system was down due to a hack and elections could be manipulated. So in Australia and in Germany, people are still counting votes by hand, right? So the paper slips transported into a room and then people go on to before this party, this party all by hand. Now there is movement to do this electronically. Why can't you just click on the Internet? I want to vote for this party. You're done, and then the results will be available immediately. It all goes into a database. Finished. But do you trust this system? Really? Why didn't somebody modify this? Maybe unsure. And, um yeah, OK, this is the the screen, right? That shows you that all your files have been encrypted Very convenient, right? You can take this long thing here that you have to submit to pay your $300 in Bitcoin. You can copy this with a copy button. Very convenient. Copy this so you can paste it into your your Bitcoin paying mechanism. And then you get a message back says, yeah, money received. Check payments. Right. You click on that and then you click on decrypt and everything is back to normal. Very convenient. The hacker doesn't have to do anything. It's all automated, but clever. All right, here's the man in the middle. No. So that's a DOS attack. I explained already how this works. Uh, legit, legit, legitimate user cannot access these services anymore, right? Another threat. Deliberate software attacks so you can have viruses, worms and all these other things that are just names for particular types of malware. So viruses and worms are self replicating, So if you get infected by them inside your computer, they multiply and they send themselves out via your email system to your old address book. So all your your your friends will have, you know an email saying, You do whatever click here and they also get the virus. So they're self replicating so, and horses and back doors. We learned about this last week. You install some software, it works fine. But inside is another piece of software inserted by the hacker, and now the hacker can use that to get access into your system. That bit of software allows them to log in remotely into your system, and once they're in, they can do anything they want. So that's a Trojan horse. I told you the story about the the the city that was surrounded and attacked, and they put this wooden horse inside the men came out, opened the door. Yeah, last week. Um, they don't replicate logic bombs. That's interesting. So I work somewhere, and I I'm fearing I'm getting sacked, right, because there's something that the boss is funny or whatever. Um, so I put a time bomb into some file that is often used, like Microsoft Word. Right? The executable. So people click on this all the time to run Microsoft Word. Now, I put something in there, and, uh, and now it just sits there and nothing happens. And maybe every week or so, I have to click on some other thing to say I'm still here, right? And then the time bomb will not explode. But if I'm not there anymore because I'm hacked, I I'm sacked. Sorry. Um, I can't click on this anymore. So now the time bomb is exploding and it does something. It's deleting all the files on the computer on the on, you know, on the server or whatever. So a disgruntled employee attack a logic bomb. So it sits there. There's nothing until I tell her to do something. Polymorphic threats. So this is any sort of malware that changes itself. So that the bit pattern that sits on the disc, it's got a particular bit pattern like, uh, and this virus checker will always look at a particular pattern to say, Oh, that's a virus. I know the 00111. You know, that's the virus. And then, um, tell the user to, um, um delete the file or whatever. But if the software itself changes all the time, it changes its bit pattern. The virus checker can't find it anymore because that's not in its database. Right? So that's dangerous. So that's called the polymorphic threat. And a worm hoax is you get a warning message to pop up and say, Oh, you have a virus on your computer. Click here to remediate this and you don't have a virus. But if you click here, you have one. Right, so that's a hoax. So this is how virus checkers work. I started talking about this already. You have a file and, uh, a virus. The white thing is the virus file, and, um, then the red bits, Yeah, yeah. So a small sample of this virus file is taken. Not the whole lot. It's too big. But some small section that will do right is taken and put into the virus checker database. So now if you say check my files, it will take its database and try to find that little bit of code in all your files, right? And if it finds a file with that little bit of code, then that's the infected file. It will have that virus in it right now. If there's a zero day. The virus checker hasn't got that in its database, so it can't actually find that virus because it's the old day. But somebody now fixes this so the virus company will put that little signature into its virus file. And then you have to update your virus software right, And that's what it does. It's taking a new database onto your computer to check against. So now that new virus is in the database and you can now find it. So that's why it's always important to update your virus software because every day there's another zero day, um, that has been fixed and put into the virus checker database. So you need to have that. Otherwise you can't find it, so always update your virus software there's another way we talk about IDs is later. Intrusion detection systems is computer software that you can buy from security vendors that you installed on your computer, and it always checks the lengths of system files. So every system file in your operating system IOS or Windows or UNIX will have a certain length right, the executable or whatever. So it will check whether it's still the same lengths as it should be. If it's all of a sudden a bit bigger, something has been inserted there probably a virus, and it will raise the alarm. So that's what an IDs does. Intrusion detection system. Then we have another thread called IP spoofing. So spoofing just means to replace a number with another number. You replace a valid number with some invalid number that the hacker wants you to see. So here we have IP spoofing. So if this computer here talks to this Web server, then we talked about packets already last week, right? The packets that go over the Internet and you the routers will distribute it until it arrives there. So these packets of data will have a source and a destination IP address. We know what IP addresses are right. So these are unique identifier of source and destination computers. So it says, Well, this packet comes from this computer IP at the source and has to go to this computer IP at this destination. So all the routers, they know now where this is and they will send it there, right? That's the idea. But now the hacker goes, and it's his spoofs an IP address. He takes the valid IP address out and puts an invalid IP address that suits him in this packet. Right? The sniffer. We talked about sniffers last week. So now it's going somewhere else, and the hacker can do whatever they want with this. This is also done with caller. I DS so most nearly every day I'm getting a phone call and it says Melbourne or Sydney, and I don't have anybody in Melbourne or Sydney, So I know already this is crap. So and then I google the number and it says, you know, male escort agency or real estate agency or whatever, and I don't pick up so and I blocked the number straight away so they can't come back. But they're changing this all the time. So I get a new call tomorrow with another address with another phone number. So they're spoofing these phone numbers. They take valid phone numbers, right that they find somewhere. And they're replacing their source phone number with this other phone number. They do, um, caller ID spoofing. So I can now see this wrong caller ID. And I'm thinking, Oh, it's my friend in Melbourne, right? And pick up and then whatever that I never pick up. So I don't know what they say, and they're not allowed to actually leave a message. So if you have a message bank or something, they allowed to put messages there. Um, so that's also done with the GPS. So you can also spoof GPS locations and has been successfully done with a Tesla car. And there's a video again in your in your seven hours. Go and have a look at these videos so you can tell the Tesla car. Uh, you're not at this valid GPS position. You're actually at this valid GPS position, right? Or invalid, and tesla car will go. Oh, now to be back on the road, I've got to go over there, right and you're steering the car into oncoming traffic, right? So you can spoof GPS addresses. And also, um, you can make it go 100 and 50 on a 60 road, right? If you say well, you're actually on a road on a highway where you can go 100 and 60 right? So speed up. But you're actually over there, but it's only allowed 60 right? So, uh, turning to oncoming traffic. All these tricks these people have actually successfully done this. And they have, um, proven that, you know, GPS can be spoofed. It's also done by truck companies. They have a GPS in the truck, and you can actually buy little devices from China on the Internet that you can put into your truck. And you tell this device to tell the GPS in your car where you are so you can actually hijack your truck and go somewhere else with your goods and deliver them somewhere else, and the boss will still sink. You're on the right route because the GPS is, you know, is is overpowered with this other information. So, um yeah, so that's all GPS spoofing, so anything can be spoofed if you know how to man in the middle. We talked about this already. There's the SSL bug in, uh, in Apple's software in February 22. Sorry, 22nd of February 2014. That was a bug in in the I OS software in Apple that people could use to play man in the middle and fixed in the meantime. But this stuff happens all the time. Vulnerabilities get discovered. Spam is more an annoyance. It's not really a bug. Uh, hack, it's just getting you buy this. Buy that And the UQ has got spam Philtres that mostly cut this all out so we don't get that because we have a sophisticated spam philtre. But sometimes things like that come through. This is what a sniffer looks like. So I told you when I worked at the Department of Lands, we actually put a sniffer into the hub in our data riser, and we could see all the passwords from word documents there from the minister. And so that was a dedicated laptop that does only sniffing. This is software you can store on your Windows computer or Mac as well, and it's called via shark. You can download it from the Internet for free. Put it on your computer and you can see all the network traffic, All the packets that you now know what they are right there is displayed there and they're scrolling up. The more packets get coming through, you can see them all on the network all on this little green display there and whatever is inside the packet if it's not encrypted, if it's clear text, you can see as well. So you can put certain philtres on there that you only want to, you know, have a look at packets coming from this particular computer. And then only those packets are shown. So a lot less or packets of certain type, like HTML packets only, and then you can analyse them. This software via shark is installed on our virtual machine. And in the tutorials, we might, uh, Daniel and Sara might be able to show how this works. Uh, via UQ virtual machine. We've installed via shark and also tor browser and some other software on there that we can use in this school. And we have been told by it we are only installing this. If you're telling the students that is for education purposes only, and only used for exercises in class, Not for anything else. But you can install that on your computer download from the Internet as well. But don't use the software for anything else but in class exercises, because otherwise next semester we won't get it back. The log stuff. All right, so these are some reports. So people have been, uh, emailed a questionnaire by these particular companies and asked some questions about cybersecurity. How many? Listen that you have. And, uh, I've put these reports on blackboard. Uh, PDF reports You can see them. This is just a quick rundown that gives you an idea of your 2021. Outdated. Now, when this reporting was done, what happened? The participants of the respondents of the questionnaire organisational size, the rules represented, and then what? They answered. So have a look at that in the seven hours that you have, Um, another report cyber security reports gives you a good idea of the current or the 2022 state of security in the world. All right, so, so far in this first part, what is the time? Oh, yeah. Good to be on time In this first part, we learned about some important functions that security performs. Management must be informed about the threats, and we learned about, you know, the buzzwords in the industry and so on. But second part talks about ethics. What is ethics? So it's a branch of philosophy that involves systematising defending and recommending concepts of right or wrong. But this is not good versus evil. This is right or wrong. Now, some other words that you often hear in relationship with ethics are these legal and moral together with ethical. So is something legal? Is it moral? Is it ethical? So what's the relationship between all these words? Is that all the same thing, or is two of them the same? And the other one is different. So I've got a little questionnaire for you. If you go to this QR code, I'd like you to answer ABC DOE. Are these two things different words? Are these three things all different words or is ethical and moral the same? But legal is different and ethical and legal. The same moral is different, et cetera, et cetera. Right, So go to the QR code and give me your opinion. Do you want me to go back? Yeah, OK, I have to find the thing on. Hey, you! You good? Can I go on? What? The balance between security and usability. Yeah. Cool. So a lot of people picked E. Some people picked a and B. So that's 15 B one A and 57. Said E. Ok, thank you very much for participating. Lots of people, said E. Now let's go back. Yeah, right. So E is They are all different things, right? Most of you said this and that's actually correct. They are all different things. So morals define the personal character. Well, ethics stresses the social system in which those morals are applied. So it's like a nested thing, right? In other words, ethics points to standards or codes of behaviour expected by the group to which the individual belongs. Uq Institution of engineers, institution of computer science. Yeah, all these industry groups, they have different ethics and they have published them on their websites. The code of ethics for ACS uq. So this has got nothing with the moral which is your personal opinion. Ethics is the company that you work for. The moral doesn't normally change, but the ethics might change depending on the company you work for. So what's legal now? Legality is a society's application of ethics to the structure of society. So an act is legal if it complies to governing laws and regulations. As an act is also ethical if it complies to the ethical policies of an organisation and is also moral, if it's correct in your own opinion. So here's an example. Abortion is legal with a sort of disclaimer there at the bottom and therefore medically ethical medical institutions say well, it's ethical because it is also legal, but we think it's ethical in our country. Well, many people find it personally immoral. When you're terminating a life, it's immoral. I don't think that's right, so there could be a difference. So what is the solution to this triangular dilemma here? Well, we found we found out that it's actually a nested structure, right? So we have the moral, the person in the middle, then that person works for an organisation with some ethical standards like UQ, and this organisation is acting within a country Australia under legal under the laws imposed by the society. So you could never have anything in your ethical procedures that are illegal, right, that are against the law. You can't say, Well, if this person doesn't work for you eight hours a day, you can beat him up. No, the legal boundary says No, you can't do that. So your ethical can't overrule that. But you personally might have a different opinion. All the people who said that's all different. You were correct. But now we have a structure there rather than just floating around bubbles. So why do we talk about ethics in this course? Well, we have normally an ethical firm ethical compass. Um, but essentially, it's not always clear, especially in the use of technology. Um, what is right or wrong in particular situations? So, for example, you're all using the UQ email system, right? So does that mean UQ because they're using their hardware, their software, right? Does it mean they have a right to look at your emails? What? Well, you would have to look up the procedures UQ procedures to find out. Maybe there's something in there. It says maybe in there that only the the hardware and software at the university makes available to you can only be used for university purposes. In that case, yeah, that's fine with you. But if you use it for personal emails to your girlfriend but you don't want to see, you wouldn't want anybody to see that. But you would also have the right to see that. Because you know you're using these are supposed to only use it for work purposes for study purposes. So this is where um, yeah, there is a little bit of friction. Maybe. And you have to really make sure that you're doing the right thing. So they are standard bodies. Yeah. The Australian Computer Society AC SI mentioned before Engineers Australia. Um, ethics for professional accountants. Some of you might be into accounting. Do you have that? So all these different bodies have different ethics, and they all publicised on their Web pages. So it's a bit of blurb about the ACS because that's my background. Um and they have a code of ethics on the website. It looks like that. So you go to the a CS website and there it is. Yes, you will. And it sets the standard of behaviour. It's not exhaustive. That means, you know, it doesn't cover everything. Everything possible. It's illustrative, so you can use it as a guide and written in terms of specific behaviour that may conflict with standards from other sources. You know, it's for this particular branch of people, computer people and has some elements of subjectivity. I've done this in another course where we actually look at some questionnaires that were sent out by the ACS with particular cases like, Can this person do this? Can they look at the email or whatever? And then people from the ACS have replied to that and they had some different opinions. Some people said yes, some people said no. So there is some room for interpretation in all this, so it's use it in the spirit of the court. Now, you as business people in your companies, you will make policies right, and these policies will actually become law in your company. So if people do not do things as prescribed by the policies, then you can give them a warning. But if they keep doing it, you have the right to fire them. So if you use UQ computer equipment for something else other than your studies, you might get a warning. But if you keep doing this, you might get expelled from university, right? That's what it actually means. So these policies become law. So make sure that the policies in your company about cybersecurity, you know, are watertight and people actually stick to them. So what do you have to do? You have to publicise the policies. You have to train people in them and check that they are actually doing it right. You can't have a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hours in a city. If you don't stand there with a radar gun checking it right, everybody will go 100 if nobody actually has any consequences. So code of ethics is a framework for the ethical decision making. But policies provide specific guidance on how to implement that framework in practise, and you are in charge of policies so coming to another topic, privacy. So privacy is a state of being free from unsanctioned intrusion so intrusion that you don't agree with. So somebody is looking at something that you want to keep private. So you want free. You want to be free from these intrusions, and that's called privacy. Now that has been used as a marketing, um, strong marketing drive by iPhone, right by apple. So let's have a look at this video. Will this work? So let me copy this out and put it into the browser. Can you see this? Yeah. So, iPhone marketing video on privacy.

SPEAKER 0
That was your questions.

SPEAKER 1
I let me see. Quite very clever. So let me just fix this so it doesn't start playing on. So we clever marketing move from, um, apple. Your life is on the phone, and your life should be private. Why not your phone? So the FBI American version of the A FP Australian Federal Police, um, in 2016 has asked Apple to help them to unlock the iPhone because, uh, there was a shooter who had killed 14 people, and they have his phone, and they wanted to know what's on his phone. Right. Has he got contacts? Other people that he talks to? Is there another attack plan somewhere? So that was important for you. Protecting the people in America from more terrorist attacks. So the FBI needed to have a look at his phone, but the phone was very secure. What? Apple is very proud of that. So they asked Apple, can you unlock this for us? And they said, No, not gonna do that right immediately. Say no to the FBI. So they stated that creating such a software to actually a new version of IOS, right, that actually unlocks that that gives people the ability like the FBI, to have a secret code or something to unlock the phone that would actually undermine the security and privacy of all iPhone users. If this tool was created, it would mean that it was nearly impossible to keep it from falling into the wrong hands and used by malicious actors. So this case quickly became a highly publicised legal battle between Apple and the US government. So the FBI eventually dropped the case because they found another way of getting at the phone. So they don't say how they did that Maybe there was a private contractor or, you know, some supercomputer who who, um, decrypted it or whatever, so we don't know. But they said that they have got at the phone eventually anyway, so they dropped the case, but it sparked a huge debate. Will you weigh up national security and individual privacy, which wins What what would you do? What's your moral compass say about this? Should we allow the FBI to decode iPhones in an emergency like that? Or is it not as important as everybody's privacy? All right, I'll leave it up to you. So this has created lots of waves in the industry. It's been hailed by privacy advocates as a victory for digital rights, where some law enforcement officials have criticised the move as hindering the ability to prevent criminal activities. Now, in comparison, here in Australia, we have the Tola Act, the Tula Act, telecommunications, telecommunications and other legislation amendment Tula. So in 2018, this came on board and requires technology companies to provide law enforcement and security agents with access to encrypted communication when requested. But that's a law now. You can't say no anymore because it's law. So now it's been criticised by privacy advocates, undermines the security, and there is a PDF on blackboard called Going Dark Copus. That's the author that I would like you to read. So going dark means that the hackers or the criminals can now go can go dark, the FBI or the A P cannot see any more what they're doing because they're communicating encrypted, and that's it Finished. So have a look at this article. It talks about it now. There's an interesting case in America. The CIA actually had this stash of zero day hacks right that I talked about earlier. So they had all these ways of breaking into people's systems in the drawer in case I needed them. I didn't tell anybody, so it hasn't been fixed. There's still zero days and somebody actually hacked the CIA and got hold of all these tools and used them or made them public. So the CIA got hacked and all their secret tools hacking tools got put onto the dark Web. All right, so here in Australia, we have the privacy law in 1988. So I don't want to read this all out to have a look at these laws. Um, Telecommunication Act in 1997 Cybercrime Act 2001. The Spam Act in 2003. So people have to have an uns subscription link in your spam message so you can click on it and you don't get it anymore. That is no law privacy amendments notifiable data breaches. So if a company gets hacked, they have to tell people I got hacked right by law from 2017. Now, these red ones are important to our access and assistance bill 2018 and the surveillance legislation amendment identified in the swap bill 2021. So they are called the decryption laws in Australia. So this only applies to Australia, but it has actually, um, implications to companies outside Australia as well. So the Tola bill gives the government unprecedented powers for online surveillance data interception and altering data. So you get data that maybe has been altered by the AFP right in transmission from somebody that you trust. But it's now not what they sent anymore because the AFP has altered that because it fits their criminal research activities. Whatever. So this call to surveillance legislation, amendment identify and disrupt Act 21. So, in the olden days we had the telephone switch, we had telephone telephone. You could easily like put another speaker on this line and listen to it right. Anybody could do that. This technical know how and of course, the police could do that. And if you send a letter by mail, you could just you open the envelope and and read the mail as well. So no problem. Surveillance was, you know, undetectable and what's happening all the time. Um, but now we have unsecured email. We go into the electronic age, so unsecured email goes via routers. And again you could, you know, listen to that as well, Sniffer. Then we have unsecured voice coms. You have a talk on the phone? It goes over Wi Fi. Or, you know, four G, five G. Whatever. People can listen to this. There are actually scanners that listen to phone conversations. And sometimes things go wrong in Telstra. And all of a sudden I actually listening to somebody else on the phone. That happens sometimes very rarely. But I had this happen. I talked to somebody on the phone and all of a sudden some other voice communication I could listen to so unintentionally. But you're intentionally obviously possible as well. So modern secured person to person communication, uh, is now encrypted. So you have an email encrypted so in. You can't read that with sniffer anymore. And you also have, uh whats app, for example, that is also encrypted. So an app that talks to the app on the other side is also encrypted. So this is where people go dark, right? And what the FBI did they actually put a chat programme onto? You know, I don't know where Google Google store or whatever. And so I said, Well, this is very secure. They didn't say this is from the FBI, right? I said here I made this very secure chat app and the criminals were actually using it. But the FBI made it so they had the decryption key so they could listen to everything. So this was going on for quite some time, and the criminals thought they were having a secure communication encrypted from end to end. But the FBI made this app, so they actually listened to everything. So, um, that's one way of of doing it. So also, these switches or routers, if you have secured voice communication also, your telephone calls can now be encrypted right Then they decrypted on the other side in real time. So somebody in the middle can't listen to this anymore. It's just noise on the line. So this term was first introduced by the FBI going dark and there is this paper on blackboard that you can read about. So what is the Australian government response to going dark? Well, Tola The Tola Act on eighth of December 2018, The first law of this type, but not the last. It is an attempt from the government to counter the going dark problem faced by Australian law enforcement agencies. It creates a new operational framework for Australian law agencies seeking access to data and content help by designated communication providers within or outside the Australian jurisdiction. So communication providers could be, uh, your, um IP S your Telstra or Optus your or if you have a A cloud storage somewhere, uh, Onedrive Dropbox. Yeah, and then when I get the Tata, then no. But they also have the right to change the data, right? We saw that before. So regardless of whether the data is stored in the US or on foreign soil, the US Cloud Act can also get at the data. So the Americans have something similar. So this toller act is designed to be Co-operative. So we dive a little bit more into how this works now. So there's three levels of the Toller act. The first one is the friendly one, right? So the AFP would say you CSP which is the carrier carriage service provider. So we just call it CS P. So that could be Telstra or cloud storage or whatever. So we now ask them for voluntary assistance. Would you like to submit us this file from Alex on on on drive? Because we think he is a criminal? We need to, you know, and they can say No, we're not doing this. So this is the now if they don't want to do this, they can go to the next level. They can say we give you a technical assistance notice at 10 and now it's come becomes compulsory. You must give us assistance to get at these files. You know, if they already have the capability of doing it right, not like the iPhone, which is encrypted in the iPhone themselves. Apple cannot decrypt it themselves because it's end to end encryption and they haven't got the key for it. So if they have the ability, then they have to do it. If they get a 10. No, If they cannot do this like iPhone, they can issue a TCN a technical capability notice. And now you're telling the CSP to make software to make it possible to get at the information. And now these people, the CSN, the CSP is now free from any liability created by that so they can't be sued for giving the giving the AFP the data because they received the TCM right, they have to do it. So if they haven't got the the capabilities now, they have to make it happen. They have to develop software that makes it happen. And you can ask this. You know, this Alex person who is, I suppose criminal criminal said here there's an update for your WhatsApp or whatever right? And therefore you have to download that and then in this download are now the capabilities that let the AFP look at what you're saying. So they make a new update and you download the update and now you open and your stuff can be read by the AFP Australian Federal Police Alright, so all the people who could be could be getting served with this now the police officer you know he's unable to say, You know, I'm issuing all these directives. It has to go high up. So, you know, only the minister, in the end can, you know, make people make software to decrypt something. So there's and it might take a month or so to actually, you know, put it into force. It has to, you know, trickle up the hierarchy in the government. Not everybody is able to tell people to do this. And this is what they can do. We're moving, modifying, concealing that this has been done and so on, and they're not liable. And these are the people who are able to do this. So the attorney General in the end, can issue the highest level of the TCN. All right, so the slides will go up on back post. You can read up on this later. So then there was, uh, in 2018. The Tula bill. Uh, it creates significant interest loss of public confidence in Internet trust levels. The three new powers disruption network activity and account takeover. So the AFP can now say, Well, we want to take over Alex's, you know, Facebook account, and I'm locked out. I can't do anything with They are in there and they can issue messages and read everything. And so anything is possible. I can't take over, but they have to have reason, right? But it might not be that, you know, this person is a criminal. In the end, it might not prove guilty yet then it's investigating. So it might be that the person is innocent. But again, all the data has been exposed to the FBI and there's a link to the CIA's secret stash of hacking tools was stolen, right? The next couple of slides. I just, um, for reference not examined, um, different organisations What they do in case you want to dive deeper into this interesting the the, uh the outset, the Australian uh, cyber emergency response team, right, was actually founded by UQ and other people. And we have people from our set here on campus in, uh in long pocket. The other campus, we have a bus connection from the bus stop round about to long pocket. So they're sitting there and, uh, they're making our cybersecurity procedures for UQ. And A is also responsible for helping companies who subscribe to all they have to pay of course, um, and helping them with any hacks and how to get around them and advising them on security and so on. So it's valuable to become a member of O to take to make use of their resources, their knowledge. And that's all I've got for you today. Remember, This week is week two. So this is the week where the tutorials are. So you're either with Daniel, who is really an excellent person. Uh, he's got a lot of IT knowledge. Um, you know, make sure you ask him the right questions. And, uh, or Sarah, uh, Sarah is taking the Wednesday's tutorials, I think for the the five o'clock tutorial on Wednesdays. All right. Any questions? All right. Good. See you next week. Same bad channel. How are you going with your enigmas?
