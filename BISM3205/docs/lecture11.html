<p dir="auto">A  digital  database  containing  information  (such  as  records  of  financial transactions) that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network. also : the technology used to create such a database.</p>
<p dir="auto">A blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in  a  single  list,  called  a  chain.  Blockchains  are  used  for  recording transactions  made  with  cryptocurrencies,  such  as  Bitcoin,  and  have many other applications.</p>

<p dir="auto">Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without
going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of
the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still
required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the
double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network
timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-
based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of
the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest
pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by
nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the
longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal
structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work
chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.</p>

<p dir="auto">Proof of Work like proposed by Satoshi doesn't solve the Two
Generals Problem or the more generic Byzantine Generals Problem.
It's a probabilistic solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem,
which means the confidence that a consensus is reached is growing
with every block added to the chain, but it never reaches 100%.

<p dir="auto">The essence of the proof of work consensus mechanism is to provide evidence that the majority of nodes agree and do not lie.
A proof of work verification is difficult, costly, and time-consuming to create, but easy to verify. Bitcoin
is secure because it is computationally infeasible to attack the network. Requiring Proof of Work for participation is central to this property. Hence Bitcoin relies on computational work on cryptographic challenges as the basis for trust.</p>

<p dir="auto">The winning miner claims a block reward by adding it as a first transaction on the block. At inception, each bitcoin block reward was worth 50 BTC. The block reward is halved after the discovery of every 210,000 blocks, which takes around four years to complete. As of February 2019, one block reward was worth 12.5 BTC.</p>
<p dir="auto">In November of 2019, the price of Bitcoin was about $9,300 per bitcoin, which means you'd earn
12.5BTC * $9,300/BTC = $116,250 for completing a block.
In May 2020, the number of bitcoins (BTC) entering circulation every 10 minutes dropped by half again from 12.5 to 6.25.</p>
<p dir="auto">The next halving will likely occur in 2024.
The maximum and total amount of bitcoins that can ever exist is 21 million.
There are 2,512,225.0 bitcoins left to be mined.</p>
<p dir="auto">When all 21 million bitcoins are mined, there won't be a block reward to pay to miners.
When a Bitcoin user sends a BTC transaction, a small fee is attached. These fees go to miners and this is what will be used to pay miners instead of the block reward.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="csiro-it-contractor-spared-jail-for-mining-monero-on-supercomputer">CSIRO IT contractor spared jail for mining Monero on supercomputer</h3>
<p dir="auto">Intensive correction order imposed for 15 months.
A former CSIRO IT contractor has escaped jail time for using the country’s peak science and research organisation’s supercomputer to mine cryptocurrency.
Jonathon Khoo was sentenced to a 15-month intensive correction order at Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court on Friday after pleading guilty to the
charges.
Khoo was charged by the Australian Federal Police in May 2019 for modifying the computer systems of CSIRO without authorisation to access the
processing power.
The charges included unauthorised modification of data to cause impairment and unauthorised modification of restricted data. Magistrate Erin Kennedy on
Friday said Khoo had installed and run 2903 command scripts into CSIRO’s two high performance computers (HPC) and the Claymore Dual Miner software.
In doing so, Khoo generated $9,422 worth of cryptocurrency mining proceeds in the form of Ethereum and Monero.
While there was no “impairment to the CSIROs” operations, Kennedy said the use of the systems for period of just over a month in duration reduced the
performance of the HPC. She said the HPC was also used by the Royal Australian Navy and Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.
CSIRO put the total cost of the HPCs reduced capacity at $76,668, including hardware and software.
Kennedy described the offence as &quot;reckless&quot; with &quot;some level of planning&quot;, but acknowledged Khoo's remorse. She also noted that Khoo had admitted his
guilt to police almost immediately after a search warrant was executed in 2019.
Khoo was handed a 15-month intensive correction order - a custodial sentence served in the community - with 300 hours of community service.

started minting his coins a couple of years ago,
but late last year he was banned from selling
pre-funded coins.</p>
<p dir="auto">The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN) classified his activities as ‘money

selling empty coins. Sales resumed earlier this
year and Casascius is currently listing three
coins, along with a gold-plated savings bar.
However, none of them are priced and it is
unclear whether or not Casascius simply ran
out of stock or stopped selling them directly
altogether.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Bitcoin’s blockchain began in January 2009, when the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of
bitcoins (known as the “genesis block”).</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Currently, Bitcoin has the capacity to handle between 4-7 transactions per second (tps), which pales in
comparison to systems like VISA and Paypal. VISA can handle on average around 1,700 tps and PayPal an
average of 193 tps.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Currently, each block on the Bitcoin blockchain is able to contain 1mb of data, meaning that the block size of bitcoin is 1 megabyte.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">If you become a full node for the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning you help validate ongoing transactions, you
basically have to download the entire database first. The Bitcoin blockchain is currently 5450 GB (2024).
This represents “the total size of all block headers and transactions” since January 2009.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (every 2 weeks approximately) so that the average time between each block remains 10 minutes. The difficulty comes directly from the confirmed blocks data in the Bitcoin network.</p>
