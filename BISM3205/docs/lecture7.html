<li dir="auto">The use of public keys requires a framework of trust (why?)</li>
<li dir="auto">Trust defined as the firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something</li>

specifically, a framework for the trusted (i.e. authenticated) distribution of public keys.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Authentication: Digital certificates in a PKI system permit individuals, organizations, and Web servers to authenticate the
identity of each of the parties in an Internet transaction</li>
<li dir="auto">Integrity: A digital certificate demonstrates that the content signed by the certificate has not been altered while in transit</li>
<li dir="auto">Confidentiality: PKI keeps information confidential by ensuring that it is not intercepted during transmission over the Internet</li>
<li dir="auto">Authorization: Digital certificates issued in a PKI environment can replace user IDs and passwords, enhance security, and
reduce some of the overhead required for authorization processes and controlling access privileges for specific transactions</li>
<li dir="auto">Nonrepudiation: Digital certificates can validate actions, making it less likely that customers or partners can later repudiate a
digitally signed transaction, such as an online purchase.</li>

<li dir="auto">This level of information is therefore variable and depends on the level of trust indicated by the certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Level of trust is related to the level of assurance sought by possession (and use of) the certificate</li>

<li dir="auto">Also Known As: digital ID, certificate.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">We need strong authentication – we must further support the digital signature model (public key itself does not verify the ID of sender)</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The solution is a digital certificate – it verifies the owner of the certificate AND verifies the owner of the public key</p>

<li dir="auto">Must be scalable – grow with demand (number of users and the evolution of the types of use)</li>
<li dir="auto">Must conform to an open standard (for future focus and individual domain needs)</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">X.509 is an ITU and ISO certificate format standard (a framework or high level standard)
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">First published in 1988 – part of the X.500 Directory recommendations. Latest version is Version 3 issued in 1996.</li>
<li dir="auto">An X.509v3 certificate contains a set of basic, predefined fields and zero or more extension fields. This is the standard that business should use when a digital certificate is required (and it frequently is) – it is very widely recognised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Each certificate contains the public key of a user and is signed with the private key of a CA
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">(does the certificate contain the PRIVATE KEY?)</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="root-and-user-level-certificates">Root and user-level certificates</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Characteristics of certificates generated by CA:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Any user with access to the public key of the CA can verify the user public key that was certified – this introduces the concept of a root certificate – the trusted distribution of the CA’s public key</li>
<li dir="auto">No party other than the CA can modify the certificate without this modification being detected – this
is because of the inbuilt digital signature control (i.e. contained within the digital certificate)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Therefore we end up with (at least) two levels of certificates:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">(1) root certificates (i.e. the certificate of a CA containing the public key of the CA), and</li>
<li dir="auto">(2) user-level certificates (containing the public key of the user and issued by the CA using its
public key)</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="digital-certificates-continued">Digital certificates (continued)</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A primary responsibility of a CA is to revoke certificates (they have an expiry date – but sometimes
it is necessary to ‘remove’ the  certificate from general circulation before this date is reached)
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)</li>
<li dir="auto">Revocation status is the most prominent information a CA maintains about the  status of a certificate</li>
<li dir="auto">Revocation reasons: key compromise, change in the subject’s affiliation, CAs  certificate has been
compromised</li>
<li dir="auto">CRLs must be publicized by CAs</li>
<li dir="auto">Distribution method – polled or pushed by certificate using software (e.g., web  browser – certificates
are used heavily by Web browsers – e.g. Firefox, IE,  etc. – more on this next week)</li>
<li dir="auto">X.509 specifies a CRL format – the format is not examinable, included here for completeness.</li>

<p dir="auto">Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (A and B) connected
by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes
read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other
by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the
communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of
communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the
transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the
application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking
layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.</p>

<p dir="auto">For over 20 years Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) has been in the market as one of the most widely ‐ used encryption protocols
ever released and remains in widespread use today despite various security vulnerabilities exposed in the protocol.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">SSL v3.0 was superseded in 1999 by TLS v1.0, which has since been superseded by TLS v1.1 and v1.2. To date, SSL and
early TLS no longer meet minimum security standards due to security vulnerabilities in the protocol for which there are no
fixes. It is critically important that entities upgrade to a secure alternative as soon as possible and disable any fallback to
both SSL and early TLS.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">The SSL protocol (all versions) cannot be fixed. SSL and early TLS (1.1) no longer meet the security needs of entities
implementing strong cryptography to protect payment data over public or untrusted communications channels. Additionally,
modern web browsers have begun prohibiting SSL connections, preventing users of these browsers from accessing web
servers that have not migrated to a more modern protocol.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="secure-email-options-for-our-use-1">Secure Email options for our use (1)</h3>
<p dir="auto">Standard Gmail uses TLS for securing email. TLS is an open security protocol (very good) and it is the
successor to SSL. But TLS only secures data between the sending client (usually a browser) and the
receiving server (we stressed this in our course – TLS is very secure it is totally a ‘transmission’ security
protocol). The data (in our case, an email) is not stored securely on the sending client – and it is not
secured whilst on the receiving server. You could call this ‘point to point’. It is certainly not ‘end to end’. It
does not, for example, guarantee that the message will remain private or available only to the intended
recipient once it reaches the destination mail server. Google itself can see messages associated with your
account, which is what allows it to scan your email for potential spam and phishing attacks (and show you
related ads).
Beyond that basic form of encryption, Gmail supports an enhanced standard known as S/MIME — or
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (explained next paragraph). You have to supply a certificate
that may cost money. S/MIME allows emails to be encrypted with user-specific keys so that they remain
protected during delivery and can be decrypted only by the intended recipient. This is the meaning of ‘end
to end’ – the sender (e.g. you/me) is one end. The receiver (i.e. the person – not the email server) is the
other end.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>S/MIME</strong> is very secure – it actually ‘triple wraps’ email data. When we use S/MIME we have the option to
secure our email for integrity/authentication (digital signing) or for confidentiality (via encryption) OR
BOTH. If we want to secure our email for confidentiality, we do the following: (1) compose the email; (2)
our email agent (e.g. Outlook) then generates a symmetric session (one time) key and uses this key to
encrypt our email; (3) our email agent then uses the public key of the intended recipient to encrypt the
session key – and this encrypted result is added to the email. This is then sent to the recipient who will
then use her/his private key to decrypt the session key – and then use the session key to decrypt the
actual email.
This ‘end to end’ encryption ensures nobody (in transit) can view the actual email content. (Actually the
‘triple wrap’ does a little more – but that is not important here). S/MIME is now very popular within
corporates and government departments. However S/MIME does present ‘key management’ challenges
(because nobody – other that sender/receiver) can access the emails – and because the sender needs the
public key (via the digital certificate) of the intended receiver.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PGP</strong> has been around since the early 1990s and it has always been highly respected. At a high level of
analysis, it is similar to S/MIME (or probably better to say S/MIME is similar to PGP). The message is
encrypted via a symmetric (session) key generated by the sender. The message and its session key are
sent to the receiver. The session key is protected during transmission because it is encrypted with the
receiver's public key. PGP is an excellent email security system – however it seems to have ‘lost out’ to
S/MIME (especially when Microsoft adopted S/MIME for its email system Outlook).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>ProtonMail</strong> is a relative newcomer. It is very well designed at many levels to achieve high security. It also
uses ‘end to end’ security for its email content – achieved via a combination of public and symmetric key
crypto (like S/MIME and PGP). It also offers high level of security for user authentication (i.e. logging onto
email accounts).  Possibly the only area of criticism of ProtonMail is that it has (in the past years) been
subject to concentrated distributed denial of service attacks that have been designed to ‘complicate’ user
access to email and accounts.</p>
