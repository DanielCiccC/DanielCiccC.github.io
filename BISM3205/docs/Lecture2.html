<h2 dir="auto" id="summary-part-1">Summary (Part 1)</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Information security performs four important functions to ensure information assets remain safe and
useful</li>
<li dir="auto">Management must be informed about threats to its people, applications, data, and information
systems, and the attacks they face.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Threats: any events or circumstances that have the potential to adversely affect operations and
assets.</li>
<li dir="auto">Attack: an intentional or unintentional act that can damage or otherwise compromise information and
the systems that support it.</li>
<li dir="auto">Vulnerability: a potential weakness in an asset or its defensive controls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">Threats can fall into 10 categories (Note: we did not cover all of them today, see also textbook)
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Important to remember: internal/external origin; malicious/accidental origin</li>

<h1 dir="auto" id="ethics">Ethics</h1>
<h3 dir="auto" id="moral-vs-ethical">Moral vs. Ethical</h3>
<p dir="auto">Morals define personal character, while ethics stress a social system in which those morals are applied.
In other words, ethics point to standards or codes of behaviour expected by the group to which the
individual belongs (national ethics, social ethics, company ethics, professional ethics, family ethics). So while a person’s moral code is usually unchanging, the ethics he or she practices can be other-dependent.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" id="legal-vs-ethical">Legal vs. Ethical</h3>
<p dir="auto">Legality is a society's application of ethics to the structure of society.
An act is legal if it complies to governing laws and regulations whereas an act is also ethical if it complies to ethical policies of an organisation and it is also moral if it is correct in your opinion.</p>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Example:
Abortion is legal* and therefore medically ethical, while many people find it personally immoral.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="why-do-we-talk-about-ethics">Why do we talk about “Ethics”?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Most of us, day to day, have a firm ethical compass So why talk about ethics at all?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Essentially, it’s not always clear, particularly in technology work, what is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ in a particular situation</li>
<li dir="auto">Professional ethics provides frameworks to support ethical decisions in uncertain scenarios</li>

<li dir="auto">It is the public voice of the IT professional; the guardian of professional ethics and standards in IT; with a commitment to the wider community to ensure the beneficial use of IT.”</li>

<h3 dir="auto" id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">One of the hottest topics in information security:</li>
<li dir="auto">Privacy is a “state of being free from unsanctioned intrusion”</li>
<li dir="auto">Ability to aggregate data from multiple sources allows creation of information databases previously
unheard of</li>
<li dir="auto">Many types of privacy issues: spamming, fraud, government intrusion.</li>
<li dir="auto">Information Privacy: ”the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves
when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others”.
(Alan Westin – Columbia University 1967)</li>
<li dir="auto">Is privacy the same as confidentiality?</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="iphone-privacy">iPhone Privacy</h3>
<p dir="auto">In 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asked Apple to help them unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, who had killed 14 people in a terrorist attack. The FBI was unable to access the phone's data due to its strong encryption and the passcode protection. The agency requested that Apple create a new version of its iOS software that would bypass the iPhone's security features and allow the FBI to access the data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apple refused to comply with the request, stating that creating such a software would undermine the security and privacy of all iPhone users. The company argued that once such a tool was created, it would be nearly impossible to keep it from falling into the wrong hands and being used for malicious purposes.
The case quickly became a highly publicized legal battle between Apple and the US government. The FBI
eventually dropped the case after finding a third-party solution to access the iPhone's data, but the incident sparked a wider debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy.
Apple's refusal to create a backdoor to the iPhone's security features has since been hailed by privacy
advocates as a victory for digital rights, while some law enforcement officials have criticized the move as hindering their ability to prevent and investigate criminal activities.</p>

<h3 dir="auto" id="in-comparison-tola-act-in-australia">In comparison: TOLA Act in Australia</h3>
<p dir="auto">In 2018, the Australian government passed the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (TOLA) Act, which requires technology companies to provide law enforcement and security agencies with access to encrypted communications when requested. The law has been criticized by privacy advocates, who argue that it undermines the security and privacy of users and could potentially weaken overall cybersecurity.</p>

<li dir="auto">Short paper: ‘Going dark’: the unprecedented government measures to access encrypted data – Arthur
Kopsias – Feb, 2019 (On course Blackboard site)
“The greatest benefit of encryption also creates the biggest problem. Secure, encrypted communications
are being used by terrorist groups and organised criminals to avoid detection, and the inability of law
enforcement agencies to read or even partially understand encrypted communications has presented real
challenges for these agencies worldwide.”</li>
<li dir="auto">The trust created by secure communications is essential for digital business.</li>
<li dir="auto">‘End-to-end’ encryption – incorporated into email two decades ago</li>
<li dir="auto">‘End-to-end’ encryption – since approximately 2015 incorporated into mobile telephony services and various apps.
This has been developed into a very powerful marketing concept by corporate communication companies (see video
from Apple on next slide)</li>
<li dir="auto">Over 90 percent of telecommunications information being lawfully intercepted by the Australian Federal Police now
uses some form of encryption.</li>
<li dir="auto">End to end security (i.e. digital privacy) now a very significant marketing discourse for the corporate telcos</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Schedule 1 of the TOLA Act inserts a new ‘Industry Assistance’ section into the Telecommunications Act 1997.
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">A new operational protocol by which Carriers/Carriage Service Providers (‘CSPs’) will provide assistance to law enforcement and security agencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">This ‘Industry Assistance’ framework contains three distinct new powers which allow an agency
head to issue:</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>‘technical assistance request’</strong> (TAR) for voluntary assistance from the CSP</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>‘technical assistance notice’</strong> (TAN) for compulsory assistance from the CSP – this power is
used in cases where the CSP is already capable of providing the assistance.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>‘technical capability notice’</strong> (TCN) for new capabilities. This notice can only be used by the
Australian Attorney-General and requires a CSP to create a specific capability where the CSP is
not currently able to assist.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">CSP - carrier service provider</p>

<li dir="auto">Free from liability - have to make the software to make it happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">The term ‘Carriers/Carriage service providers (CSPs)’ is broadly defined in the Act so that it includes the wide range of entities integral to the 21 st century Australian communications operational environment.
The main descriptors are as follows:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">CSPs that are based in Australia, and those providers based offshore who operate or supply communications services, devices or products for use within Australia.</li>
<li dir="auto">Anyone who facilitates the services of CSPs.</li>
<li dir="auto">Electronic service providers (with at least one end-user in Australia) and anyone who facilitates the services of electronic service providers, e.g. Facebook, Google, and Amazon Web Services;
and</li>
<li dir="auto">Manufacturers of electronic equipment and anyone who facilitates the manufacture of electronic equipment used in Australia, e.g. Samsung, Apple.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="tolaact---overview---what-kind-of-assistance">TOLAAct - overview - what kind of assistance?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Section 317E sets out, in some detail, the types of assistance that may be specified. These types
include (but not limited to):</li>
<li dir="auto">Providing technical information.</li>
<li dir="auto">Facilitating access to services and equipment.</li>
<li dir="auto">Removing one or more forms of electronic protection.</li>
<li dir="auto">Modifying technology.</li>
<li dir="auto">Concealing that the company has done any of the above.</li>
<li dir="auto">Example: The assistance may require the issue (to a specific criminal suspect) of a notice to update
messaging software – when in fact the ‘update’ will then allow access to the messages of that suspect.</li>
<li dir="auto">No introduction of systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities (also know as ‘backdoors’ for
encryption mechanisms)</li>
<li dir="auto">Civil immunity is available for CSPs acting in good faith to ensure that they are protected from any legal risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto" id="other-details">Other details</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto"><strong>Organisations</strong>: The use of the powers has been restricted to the Australian Federal Police, the
Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the
Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Signals Directorate, and State and Territory Police
forces.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Responsible officer</strong>: ATAR or a TAN may be issued by the head (or delegate) of each agency above.
ATCN may only be issued by the Attorney-General</li>
<li dir="auto">b: The use of the powers is connected to the safeguarding of national security or
(for State/Territory/Commonwealth Police) the enforcing of criminal law so far as it relates to serious
Australian or foreign offences (defined as punishable by a maximum term of 3 years imprisonment,
or more, or for life’.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Enforcement</strong>: The framework is not intended to be adversarial – it intends to engender a spirit of
cooperation. However – civil penalty for contravention is $10 million for corporate entities and
$50,000 for private individuals.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Oversighting and reporting</strong>: The Commonwealth Ombudsman or Inspector- General of Intelligence
and Security. The use of industry assistance powers is subject to annual reports to the Home Affairs
Minister.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The TOLA Bill was introduced to the Australian Parliament on 20 September 2018.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The Bill created significant interest (here and abroad) – the main concerns were:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Perceived privacy implications</li>
<li dir="auto">Withdrawal of international corporate investment in Australia,</li>
<li dir="auto">Loss of public confidence in Internet trust levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The Bill was subsequently referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS)
for inquiry and report.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The PJCIS then received a very large number of submissions expressing concerns with the Bill (from the Law
Society of NSW, the Law Council of Australia, carrier industry providers, law enforcement/security agencies, and a
large number of other commercial and private legal institutions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">The Bill became law on 8 December 2018. The reason given for the rapid passage of these complex reforms: a
heightened risk of terrorist incidents over the Christmas and New Year period (2018)</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Updates Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and Telecommuications Act 1979/1997</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Three new powers:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">“data disruption warrants”: allow authorities to “disrupt data” by copying, deleting or modifying data
as they see fit</li>
<li dir="auto">“network activity warrants”: permit the collection of intelligence from devices or networks that are
used, or likely to be used, by subject of the warrant</li>
<li dir="auto">“account takeover warrants”: let agencies take control of an online account (such as a social
media account) to gather information for an investigation.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">What’s different to previous laws?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Telecommunications Act 1997: only permits to intercept or access communications and data under certain circumstance.</li>
<li dir="auto">Identity and Disrupt Bill 2021: unprecedented interception or “hacking” powers (access can be gained to encrypted data which could be copied, deleted, modified, and analysed even before its relevance can be determined).</li>
</ul>
