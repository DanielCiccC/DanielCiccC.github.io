<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Rationale: An information security standard – targeting merchants and service provides – protects<br>
credit/debit card data during storage, transmission, processing – not aimed directly at customers</li>
<li dir="auto">Origins:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">2001 – Visa mandated adoption of CISP (a security program) – 12 security requirements</li>
<li dir="auto">Other brands developed their own:
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">American Express – Data Security Operating Policies (DSOP)</li>
<li dir="auto">Discover – Information Security Compliance (DISC)</li>
<li dir="auto">MasterCard – Site Data Protection Program (SDP)</li>
<li dir="auto">JCP – Data Security Program (DSP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">2004 – Visa &amp; MasterCard merged their security programs into a single standard – PCI DSS.</li>
<li dir="auto">2006 – Visa, MasterCard, Am Express, Discover Financial Services &amp; JCB International formed the
PCI Security Standards Council to manage the evolution of the  PCI DSS.</li>
<li dir="auto">2022 – most recent version PCI-DSS 4.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">The PCI-DSS is not law and compliance enforcement and non-compliance penalties are set by an individual
brand through contractual penalties or sanctions. E.g. Visa &amp; MasterCard transactions are enforced by the
merchant’s acquirer. American Express deals directly with its merchants for compliance.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">PCI-DSS is the top-level standard.</li>

<li dir="auto">PCI PTS (PIN Transaction Security) applies to manufacturers of personal identification number (PIN) entry terminals used for
payment card financial transactions.</li>
<li dir="auto">PCI Point-to-Point Encryption Standard (P2PE). As the payment card is swiped through a merchant’s card reading device
(the point of interaction (POI) device), the data is immediately encrypted. The encrypted data is then sent immediately to the

making card data entirely invisible to the retailer.</li>

<p dir="auto">(p.10 PCI DSS v3.2.1)
The PCI DSS security requirements apply to all system components included in or connected to the cardholder
data environment. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is comprised of people, processes and technologies
that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data. “System components” include
network devices, servers, computing devices, and applications. Examples of system components include but are
not limited to the following:
• Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers), facilitate segmentation (for
example, internal firewalls), or may impact the security of (for example, name resolution or web redirection
servers) the CDE.
• Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual
applications/desktops, and hypervisors (Beyond our scope)
• Network components including but not limited to firewalls, switches, routers, wireless  access points,
network appliances, and other security appliances.
• Server types including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network
Time Protocol (NTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).
• Applications including all purchased and custom applications, including internal and external (for example,
Internet) applications.
• Any other component or device located within or connected to the CDE.</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Network segmentation of, or isolating (segmenting), the cardholder data environment from the remainder of an entity’s
network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is strongly recommended as a method that may reduce:
• The scope of the PCI DSS assessment
• The cost of the PCI DSS assessment
• The cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls
• The risk to an organization (reduced by consolidating cardholder data into fewer, more controlled locations)
Without adequate network segmentation (sometimes called a &quot;flat network&quot;) the entire network is in scope of
the PCI DSS assessment</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">Many e-commerce solutions exist that provide most or the entire merchant’s online shopping
functionality and experience. These solutions provide more than just transaction processing
capability, often including customer-facing features such as product search, cart capability, checkout,
and account  management; and back-office features such as product management, customer
relationship management, order management, and appearance customizations.</li>
<li dir="auto">A hosted shopping cart is an e-commerce system that is hosted entirely on the service provider’s
technological infrastructure. The e-commerce is not seamlessly integrated into the merchant’s
website and the consumer is often directed off-site to select product and complete checkout.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>MERCHANT IMPACT</strong>: The use of such a solution can alleviate many but not all of the merchant’s PCI
DSS responsibilities. All merchants have a responsibility to implement policies and procedures that
govern safe handling of cardholder data even if they never expect to encounter credit cards. Furthermore,
it is the  responsibility of the merchant to vet the service provider and monitor its compliance to PCI DSS.

<li dir="auto">page 19 in the handout, explains in more detail</li>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In the URL redirection model, the cardholder is redirected from the merchant’s website to a third-party
page. The cardholder then enters their account data into a payment page hosted by the third-party
payment service provider (PSP). That is, customers of the merchant are sent to a PSP’s web pages. This is
generally noticeable to the customer as the merchant’s website URL— e.g., <a href="http://www.merchant.example.com">http://www.merchant.example.com</a> — changes to that of the PSP—e.g., <a href="https://www.psp.example.com">https://www.psp.example.com</a></p>
<p dir="auto">MERCHANT IMPACT: As account data is not collected, stored, processed, or transmitted by the
merchant’s system, fewer systems need security controls - used by small and medium business
organizations with lower-than-average cardholder data volume.
This e-commerce option provides an easier way for merchants to provide security for cardholder data, as
most of the cardholder data security is performed by the PSP. It is strongly recommended that a merchant
ensure the PSP is validated as a PCI DSS compliant service provider. Number of questions under PCI-
DSS - as few  as: 22

<p dir="auto">This approach is via an Application Programming Interface (API) – it principally for ‘big-business’. In this context, an
application-programming interface (API) is a method of system-to-system data transmission in which the merchant
principally controls the progress of the payment transaction.
Customer cardholder data is sent from the customer browser back to the merchant website before being sent to the
PSP. The payment page and form are hosted and supplied by the merchant website with all cardholder data
processed by the merchant web server (and possibly other system components) before being sent to the PSP.
PCI DSS – (3) Merchant managed e-commerce implementation
28 (PCI SSC reference: “best_practices-securing_ecommerce.pdf” – page 17 – 19 inclusive)</p>
<p dir="auto">MERCHANT IMPACT:
This architecture carries a high risk for merchants as their systems will receive and transmit, and may also store and
process, cardholder data.
Hackers target websites using this payment method because there is a greater chance of larger amounts of valuable
cardholder data being available, and the attack can be easier due to varying levels of security controls among merchants.
Due to the higher risk of compromise to merchant systems, the level of security responsibly for the merchant is high.

<p dir="auto">As most data breaches involve a compromise of the CDE, PCI DSS requirements require a wide variety of
security controls to be maintained to help protect this data.</p>
<p dir="auto">In summary, the CDE consists of:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li dir="auto">All system components that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).</li>
<li dir="auto">Any component that directly connects to CHD systems.</li>
<li dir="auto">Any component that supports CHD systems (such as anti-virus, authentication servers).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Clearly, PCI DSS auditing costs and data breach risk are both lowered by reducing the CDE to its bare minimum</p>
